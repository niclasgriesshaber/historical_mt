      "Appears in the princely manorial court of Friedtlandt, with report, that after his house was plundered by captain Maste's soldiers in 1621 after he was reported by evil people, who had taken his money and household goods, also he himself was conducted to Friedland into the town prison, and held there for several days, but when, afterwards, he was released again on other reports and the manorial court's desire, he had still something in entire Talers which he had earned through his effort and diligence and had held together, which, as he reports, were 240 Talers, and had had stored in the barn; and because he was afraid of further misfortune and invasion, he took this money and put it in a pot and kept it on the frontmost Heivelberge above the Waaldt Bruch pond in a stone cliff, quite deep, to which as time passed, he went on about 3 occasions, and fetched money for his necessity, up to 12 Talers. around Michaelmas in the past year 1630, however, he went out for the last time to fetch the above-mentioned money for his wedding, but when he came to it he found the pot standing very far forward, and in it were no more than 1. Stein MooÃŸ, and 35 pieces of Imperial and Ferdinand Talers, therefore he ran to the neighbours and complained about this, asked them, if one or another person knew anything about this, that they might be helpful to him. During this investigation, he found out so much and obtained news that Christ. IHausman in Raspenaw, was exchanging such varieties of old money, for which reason he had him spoken to by himself and by others, and he did not deny it, but when he was summoned into the manorial court he admitted that in the autumn of 1630 he was in the hills and came across the money, and took 104 Talers of it, but when he was asked what he was doing in the hills, he had not been able to answer anything more than that one was always having things to do in the hills, which leads to the conclusion that he had deliberately followed Tschidel and thus had found out. The said HauÃŸman however reports further that after the new year of this year 1631, although which day he did not actually know, he had stuck 88 Reichstalers by night in through Hans Tschidell's window, the remaining 16 Talers he had consumed. Tschiedel however does not admit anything more than that he had found 46 Talers, asks therefore because Augsten took one away, to help him to it that he also pay him the others. Austen insists once again upon it, that it had been 88 Reichstalers, now whether it was the servants, or whoever else had taken from it, he does not know. And because he Haussmann excuses himself on the grounds that he did not take the money wholly, saying thereby that he speculates, because Hans Tschidel's son Christof before his wedding had dressed himself very dignifiedly and fancily, that he might have received some of this money. Upon this he Augsten was given 8 days for consideration, such that he shall report back in then and make detailed report, also testify concerning what he has to bring forward in detail, and so that this shall certainly occur, Georg RÃ¶ssell village headman in Raspenaw is pledge for him. On 11th April the village headman Georg RÃ¶ssel delivered Christof Austen in here, who, because he did not want to say anything who had taken the rest, was held in arrest. Since the said Hausman was held in arrest until 23 May, and had very little to his own best interest, therefore both village headmen in Raspenaw and Mildenaw interceded for him, so that he would be released from imprisonment, and are as pledges to deliver him back when it is demanded, and thus it was dismissed.\n",

      "There appeared in the princely manorial court of Friedland, with report that in 1621 his house was plundered by Capitan Matest's soldiers, his money and household goods were taken, he was also carted into the town in prison and held there for several days, but when he afterwards reported again and was released on request of the manorial court, he had some thousand Reichstalers which he earned through his farm and diligence, which he reports was 240 Talers, he kept in a chest, and because he was afflicted with further misfortune and accident, he took this money and put it in a pot, and in a stone ditch deep in the woods, beside the forest break, and he walked across it several times, and fetched from it what was needed, for 12 Talers, but on Michaelmas last year he came out of it and went to collect the said money for his wedding, but when he came there he found the pot far away, and not more than a stone moss and 35 pieces, Reichstalers in it, according to this the neighbours complained to him, and asked him if he knew anything about it, that he would help them. In answer to this inquiry, he obtained information that Christof Hausman in Raspenau, was selling this sort of old money, for which he himself and others had spoken to him about, who denied it, but when he was questioned in the manorial court he admitted it, that he was in the herbste in 1630, and got the money from it, he took 104 Talers from it, but when he was asked what he had in the herbste he could not answer anything other than that he had always done in the herbste, it was concluded that he had carried the chest with him and thus it was known. The said HauÃŸman reports further that recently this year, on the new year's day which he does not actually know the exact date, he found 88 Reichstalers to Hans Tschidell in the window in the night, the remaining 16 Talers he consumed. Tschiedel however does not admit anything more than that he found 46 Talers, asks for help because the Austen took it away, that he should also replace it to him. Again it is decided that it was 88 Reichstalers, whether the servants or anyone else took it away he does not know. And because he HauÃŸmann excuses himself for not taking the money, saying that he might have gotten something from it because Hans Tschidell's son Christof was very well-dressed for his wedding, he is given 8 days' consideration, so that when he is then he shall report in detail what he knows and what he wishes to add, and that this shall be certain, pledges are Georg RÃ¶ssell village headman in Raspenau.

But concerning their petitions and grievances in detail, and especially concerning BÃ¶hmisch Neustadt, the lord his grace issues decision, that they are well aware that the NeustÃ¤dt have informed the lord national officers of their freedoms and favours, that they may serve beer and wine, and have it fetched, wherever they like, and may make use of this freedom in all ways like other mining towns, and you will also remember, how difficult it was in the oath of allegiance of the NeustÃ¤dters, what kind of threatening words they allowed to be heard from themselves against the FriedlÃ¤nders, and on this they pleaded, because they are poor people, and the mining there is poor and small, not to rob them of their freedoms, and treat them counter to justice. 3. The tavern and drink serving in Arnsdorf, and the rights of it there, are at present mortgaged for a certain sum of money to the lord his grace, and therefore the lord his grace is well entitled to make use of the said right because of the money he has spent on it.

If his grace had wanted to hear their petition, they should have done it with a smaller number of people, they should have transferred their complaint and petition to his grace himself or the manorial court appointed to him, and because his grace is mild and what they did previously done his grace will not let them do, but rather they will be punished for it. 2. Their petitions and grievances which they submitted, but in particular concerning the Neustadt, his grace gave them this decision, that they are well aware that the Neustetters reported their freedoms and favours equally with the Landesoffiziere, and said that they beer- and wine-serving and fetching, where it is permitted and agreeable, and they can make use of this freedom like other mining-activities. They will also recall how difficult the Neustetters were in swearing allegiance, what they heard and heard they had let themselves be persuaded against the Friedlanders, and asked, because they poor people the mining-people there were poor and scant, not to rob them of their freedom, and to name it counter to justice. 3. The village tavern and Inn in Arnsdorf and the right of the latter was currently held by his grace for a certain sum of money, for which reason his grace wanted to make use of the same right concerning the money he spent, and the other community, which was not entitled to pay for their tavern-keeping, but to force the village headman to serve beer, his grace did not know how to force them to do this, but rather how it would be just to force them to do it. 4. his grace had previously granted the Friedlanders a privilege concerning their tavern-keeping, they should serve beer to all, but if his grace knew that they were doing it, they should not be allowed to do it further but rather be abolished from it, and likewise the village headman and Innkeeper should not be permitted to do it further.\n",

The following was brought forward by both parties: the boardcutter brings forward, on Monday 8 days ago it occurred thus, that the castle-miller asked him, because he had sold a house, that he would help drink at the leasing-Sale, which occurred at the lord Richter's, which he did, when they were finished, he went home in the evening, and lay down to his rest, and in the morning early got about about 4 o'clock and there were lots of people standing on the Michl Hof, the Wednesday after that his? daughter-in-law had gone into the town, she encountered the goldsmith's second daughter at die Adam Grosmannin, and she said to her what news can I tell you, your father-in-law has lain with my sister, thereupon his? daughter-in-law asked where it occurred, she answered below the board-mill on the Saw-Spann, she further said I will tell this to my father-in-law as soon as I get home thereupon she answered, be silent about it, my father and mother have taken council about this that they will wait for 4 weeks, when the 4 weeks are over they will see whether she has been damaged, if she hasn't been damaged they will remain silent. Now when his? Daugther-in-law told him this, he sent his wife to the goldsmith to have her asked whether she admitted these words, his wife brought back that she die Goldschmiedin was complaining to heaven that he had thus damaged her daughter, thereupon he sent Hans Leibner to her, who brought him in answer that his the goldsmith's daughter was supposed to have uttered shameful words about him in the presence of her parents, so that he got angry about this, hereupon he went to the lord Richter and asked him for advice thereupon they were summoned on the second day and heard, and when the lord Richter heard both sides, he seriously asked the lass where she had met him, that they had come together, she answered, on the bleaching-ground, further asked where he had led her, she answered below the board-mill on the Saw-Span he asked her further, what he had further done to her, he had blocked her bed, the lord Richter asked her further, what he had done to her, she answered, he had taken his thing out of his trousers and stuck it in her thing the lord Richter had further asked because so many boys were there, whether no-one had seen it, she said yes she knew those who had seen it, he asked who they had been, she answered Christoff Rudeiger's, also who further had seen it, she answered Christoff Floeckens. Now he had dwelt for 23 years and no-one would be able to say of him that he had ever used an fornicationige word about women, daughters, or maids, asks that he be taken into just protection, also insofar as he be found guilty of the deed, he asks that he be punished according to the severity of the law, he will patiently endure it if he has deserved it.\n",

      "The village headman in Ruckersdorff brings forward, he walked in here a fortnight ago last Monday, wanted to get information from lord domain-captain about how he should do it with the soldiers, then he encountered the village headman in Schonwalda beside Knoblochen in the lane, wished him good morning, asked him where he was going, he said he wanted to go into the manorial court and ask what the situation was with the soldiers, he answered he didn't have to, he had already been in the manorial court, he would tell him it, then he turned around with him, down the lane said to him, Godfather, yesterday you did not do right, along with the clerk, he asked why, what was it, I commanded the clerk, 8 days ago yesterday, to come up here and write up the taxes, then he was supposed to write up a purchase in Schoenwalda, and the clerk had forgotten to do it, afterwards the second Sunday he sent his servant down there to Schonwalda and had him say to the clerk that he should go forth so that he could write up the taxes, then the clerk had it said to him through his maid, didn't he have a mouth so that he could have told me it, the village headman in Schonwalda had forbidden him to go, or he should never again write for him in the village tavern. 14 days previously in Ruckersdorf he had also had a purchase, and he had commanded the schoolmaster, when he was finished, he should go to Schonwalda and write up the taxes, this he thus told to the village headman, they thus went with one another into the wine-cellar, now when they came into the wine-cellar, they drank with one another, afterwards they thought about the pastor in Schonwalda, the village headman there said he always gives me stings, soon I will stop going to church, then he said to him he should not do this, he was also a poor sinner. finally he said they were always on top of one another, the pastor had said about him that he had had a confession-chair built for him, he can call it a cheese-basket, he should not remain long in the church, than the Seiger in the vicarage, besides he said he had the Prae, thereupon he the village headman in Ruckersdorf said he did not have the Prae, but rather the lord his grace. Thereupon Friederich von Kyaw said, you are godfathers and neighbours, let it be, and drink a toast to one another, thereupon the village headman in Ruckersdorf said, I have absolutely no anger with him, thereupon the village headman of Schonwalda drank to him, hereupon the old Schoesserâ€™s wife/widow came into the wine-cellar, wanted to talk to him, he stood up and talked to her for perhaps half an hour, likewise drank up one drink alongside, now when he had finished talking he came back to the table, said I and my clan have dwelt in Schoenwalda for some 200 years, and thou shalt Vulua be caught with many, thereupon he answered not a Meidt I am an honourable man, thereupon he said, thou art a villain not a Mendt, I am an honourable man, thereupon he said, thy father was burnt, thereupon he said but he lies buried in Schonwalda, then Friederich von Kyaw said, hey what are you doing, the old village headman lies buried in Schonwalda, the village headman however did not do anything else besides, so that he thus did not know if he meant it seriously or not. After 3 days he went to the tavernkeeper and asked him for advice, what he should do, he must complain about it either in the Gericht or in the manorial court, and whether he had also heard the words, then the tavernkeeper said it is good that you come yourself, I wanted now to go to the magistrate and report it to him, but because you come yourself, you can report it yourself, thereupon several citizens said he should first send in advance with a couple of men whether he admitted the words, perhaps he had been jesting, which he did, sent to him thus, then he had it said to him that he had no anger against him and did not know what he had said, after all he had walked to the grave with his father, next Tuesday 8 days ago they came together at Heinrich Seideln's then the village headman in Schonwalda had drunk one to him, gave him his hand and asked for forgiveness, then he said to him, if he had not said one thing he would be perfectly satisfied with him, namely that his father had been burnt, thereupon he said he had not meant him but rather someone who had passed through Friedland, and had been burnt in Friedeburg thereupon he walked up here and reported it to the lord domain-captain. The village headman in Schonwalda reports: when they had walked out of the church he and the village headman in Ruckersdorf had spoken with one another about the soldiers, also left it how they would have it with one another, afterwards when they had finished he said to the clerk, come down there is a bad purchase to write down, when he came in and wrote up the purchase the village headman of Ruckersdorf sent 2 messengers down and had them say to the clerk, he should but come and write up the taxes, thereupon he told him to go but along with this asked the clerk whether it had been told to him in advance, and he answered nothing had been said to him, thereupon he said to him he might go, if he would only finish up the purchase, then he would write down the purchase and take the fee, whereby it thus remained. Now after they had met in the street in Friedland, this was repeated. Also the confession-chair was thought of, that he had called it a cheese-basket, which he did not admit, that he had called it thus, the village headman in Schonwalda said that they had just as much right in the church as they did, and no-one wished to take it away from them, thereupon he the village headman in Ruckersdorf said, I am just as much an honourable man as another, then he the village headman of Schonwalda said, previously a man was carted through Friedlant who was afterwards burnt in Friedeberg now when he was sent to by the village headman of Ruckersdorf, he answered, how should he have said this, he had after all walked to the grave with his father, and besides said they were after all blood-kin with one another, if he defamed him then he had defamed himself, and knew nothing of him, also they both afterwards went up to the castle with one another and bought the four horses, afterwards drank the lease-purchase with one another, sat beside one another. Then Paper-Caspar began saying, there sit the biters, one Menge between the evil village headmen, thereupon the village headman of Ruckersdorf began to say, lord godfather, how did you mean it, the village headman of Schonwalda, I mean it well, we will do well with one another, thereupon they drank to one another again, remained sitting with one another, and afterwards parted silently and went home. The tavernkeeper is questioned about this, reports: several weeks ago the two village headmen had come into the wine-cellar, they must have got into conflict sometime before in the lane, they had mentioned the church- or confession-chair, but they had not defamed each other seriously, after that Old Schosserâ€™s wife/widow came in, thereupon the village headmans of Schonwalda stood up and sat himself to Schosserâ€™s wife/widow at another table, and thus talked to one another, what it was he did not know. Now when he stood up he walked over to the table, called the village headman in Ruckersdorf a liar several time, who asked that he not do that, finally he called him a villain, the one from Ruckersdorf defamed him with the same name, thereupon the village headman of Schonwalda said that his were burnt, then the tavernkeeper said to him, I cannot remain silent about this, the next day the village headman of Ruckersdorf came and said that God pity us, what has my godfather done, how shall I act, thereupon he said, you must report it, if not I will do it myself, thereupon the village headman said he would himself report it into the manorial court, or to his grace, and thereby it thus remained. Sentence: since the village headman of Schonwalda attacked the village headman of Ruckersdorf in the wine-cellar with defamatory words, concerning which his grace, because the village headmen shall provide a good example to other serfs, is ungraciously displeased, therefore his grace had the village headman of Schoenwalda as the initiator set in the tower with the explicit command that he shall not be released from this imprisonment until he has paid his grace 50 Talers fine, likewise Jacob Tobinger the tavernkeeper is stuck in the lock-up because he did not report this conflict to the magistrate in Friedland right away, shall likewise not be released from prison until he has paid 10 Schocks fine. The tavernkeeper paid 10 Schocks on 11 may 1619.\n",

      "Hans Pilz in CunnerÃŸdorff complains against Matz Pilzen, that the latter defamed him in the village court in Ringenhain, he had paid GÃ¶rge Brendeln a quarter of wheat, who had previously beaten him, and in doing so he had acted like a villain. Maz Pilz answers, he is harrassed everywhere by the Friedlanders, he has to pay something more than what anyone else has paid, that he ought not to do. village headman in Ringenhain gives testimony: Maz Pilz said that the Pilzes in Cunnersdorff are always rubbing ears to him, he should also pay wheat to the furrier, but he does not do this, he had also not caused it, who is a rogue, he remains a rogue, a villain, he makes no-one into a rogue. Matz Krause gives testimony: Matz Pilz said he did not want to hold Hans Pilz as a cousin, if he had done this and had given a quarter of wheat, but rather in this he had dealt as a villain. Christoff Richter gives testimony, if it were true that Hans Pilz had gifted the furrier with wheat, then he must indeed be a villain; he had not accused him of anything further. Marten Pilz gives testimony: if someone was not a villain, then he did not give a quarter of wheat, someone must be a rogue or a villain who let himself be beaten and on top of that gave wheat. Conclusion. It emerges from this whole case that Matz Pulz defamed Hans Pilzen for this reason, that he had given furrier Georg the wheat for blows, for if he had done this then he had in doing so dealt wrongly and like a villain; but Hans Pilz himself admits that the had given the furrier the wheat as an honorarium out of good friendship, concerning which can well be deduced out of this, that Matz PÃ¼lze's intention was not to defame him for this cause, but rather what he said, this occurred in general, and therefore both parties gave their hands to one another, that neither knows anything unjust to say about the other, and also vowed that each would live with the other peaceably by fine of 30 Schocks, and not think of this further.\n",

      "Hans Pilz in Cunnersdorf complains against Matz Pilzen, the latter defamed him in the village court in Ringenhain that he paid a quarter of a waiz to GÃ¶rge Brendeln, he struck him, he did this because he was a villain. Maz Pilz answers, he was vexed with him everywhere by the Friedlanders, he had to pay more than others, what others did he was not allowed to do, village headman in Ringenhain gives testimony: Maz Pilz said that the Pilzes in Cunnersdorf were always sticking it in people's ears, he should also give waiz to Kirschner, but he did not do that, also did not know who was a rogue, he who remained a rogue was a rogue, he did not make anyone a rogue. Matz Krause gives testimony: Matz Pilz said he would not hold him, Hans Pilz, for a cousin, who gave him waiz, unless he had done this and had given him a quarter of a waiz, but he had dealt with this like a villain. Christoff Richter gives testimony: when this occurred, Hans Pilz gave waiz to Kirschner, therefore he must be a villain, he did not accuse him of anything else. Marten Pilz gives testimony: if someone was not a villain, he would not give a quarter of a waiz, someone who was a rogue or villain who struck and gave waiz to him. Conclusion: it emerges from the entire case that Matz Pulz defamed Hans Pilzen with this cause, that he gave waiz to Kirsch GÃ¶rgen for his wife/widow, since he did this, he dealt with this improperly and like a villain, but Hans Pilz himself admits that he honored Kurschner with waiz on account of good kinship, from which it can be concluded that Matz PÃ¼lze's opinion was not the cause of the defamation, but rather what he said occurred, both parties gave each other their hands so that neither knew anything improper about the other, also they have vowed, on pain of 30 Schocks fine, in future to live peaceably with one another and not to think of this any more.\n",

But he would much rather remain his grace's subject, would also provided God's evidence that he did not know that he had ever disobeyed or lived countered to his grace, and insofar as he has been spoken ill of to his grace, he asks in God's name that the person who has done this shall be set under his eyes, he would show his innocence so that all should see that he had been wronged, and insofar as after all he might have to sell up he asks for God's sake to tell him the cause, asks for longer deadline for his wife is highly pregnant and he does not know when she will give birth.\n",

Now because the said von Bobliz, after investigation which was held, learned this much, that Jakob Sichelschmidt has knowledge of this, therefore the said von Bobliz applied in the princely manorial court to have the said Sichelschmidt heard concerning this. And after the said man was summoned forward and was asked about this, he reported as follows: approximately a few months ago he came to von Bobliz's thresher whose surname is PÃ¼ltz, he was sitting at the house-door, then PÃ¼lz's wife went into an old cottage and clapped with a little glass. Thereupon he Sichelschmidt asked what was in there, and she answered, I will show you, and thereupon gave him a golden bracelet, saying you have daughters, would you not want to buy it, village headman (who keeps the court in Seidenberg) also has one. Upon this, he Sichelschmidt asked where they had got it from, whereupon she said, her husband and the village headman had carted into the malt, where they found this in a parcel on the Gorlichshaimer. Thereupon PÃ¼lz, who was in the barn, called to the village headman as his neighbour, who was greasing a wagon on his farm, with these words, godfather, do we want to sell the things, upon which the village headman answered: yes, we do want to sell it. But when he Sichelschmiedt asked how expensive, they said for 5 Schocks, thereupon he Sichelschmidt answered, it is too expensive for me, but if you want to bring it to Fridtlandt, then we can let the goldsmith see it, how much it is worth. And this was on a Wednesday. Upon this, PÃ¼lz said, next Saturday I will come to Friedtlandt to Brosius Wackern for shoes, and then I will bring them with me. When then he also came on the said day, he was however not at home. On the following Sunday early, the village headman came to him Sichelschmiden in front of his door on a horse and said, Jakob we have sold our things, one of them to the demesne man in Cunnerstorf, Bischoff, for which he gave us corn, and did not say anything further but rather rode into the town.

      "I, the undersigned, Currrently appointed domain-captain of the high-Comital Gallas manor of Friedland, hereby attest in truth, upon application of the imperial lord customs-officers in Friedland that since Andreas Dittmar from GeiÃŸdorf Lyng in Lusatia, approximately two and a half years ago reported to me in complaint how Gottfridt Richter, citizen here, at that time in the contagion period bought from him in the village of Pridlantz several Juchten, and still remained indebted money for them, and could not obtain payment on this account, the cause being because these Juchten were drawn into contraband to him Richter, thus the said Dittman brought forward that he was not any cause of this, since at the purchase he asked Gottfridt Richter and applied to him that he should on his behalf immediately report the wares to the imperial customs office and make right the proper customs payment, and however much it should amount to, subtract from him Dittmann on the purchase price, which also according to Gottfridt Richter's report occurred, and he admitted here in the manorial court to everything, that it thus remained between those two. Hereupon I, by virtue of the office I bear, commanded the said Gottfridt Richter according to recognition of justice, because he admits all this, and shall immediately pay the customs, thus Dittman was not a Verfahrer of the contraband, this burdened after him Richter, shall fully content Andreas Dittman and satisfy him in the outstanding debt. However the said Gottfridt Richter stated this reservation, that if the highly praised Bohemian Cammer should assigned the payment of the contraband to him Diettman, that he Gottfridt Richter shall be entitled to seek his recourse from him Dittmar.

Hereupon I, issuing of the manorial court's seal, Gottfridt Richter, recognized the following, according to justice, because he admits this all, and thus it should be paid, therefore the said Dittman is not a Verfahrer of this Contrabant, and therefore I command Gottfridt Richter to satisfy Andreas Dittman completely for this debt, but the said Gottfridt Richter reserved and retained this, that whoever the highly noble Bohemian chamber will recognize the payment of the Contrabant to him Dittman, that he Gottfridt Richter will demand his Recres from him Dittmar, to certify this I have signed this, and the count's manorial court's seal, Friedland castle 21 Nov 1684.\n",

The following is the resolution: firstly he Ladebach will pay him 1 cent in Vitriol on next Monday, which will be the 30th of July, and this, admittedly, in the value as it is otherwise valid, namely for 4 Reichstalers now and thus every month afterwards with 1 cent until final payment as the cents will fall or step. This Scholze is also very well satisfied. additionally Georg SchÃ¶nfelder along with Ladebach owes Merten Scholzen 7 Reichstalers, asks likewise for help. H. Ladebach answers, because he does not owe more than 3. Reichstalers 3 Argents, also he did not command Schonfelder to lend anything, therefore he cannot take it upon himself, also cannot pay more than these 3 Reichstalers 3 Argents, he will be in gratitude deliver to him.\n",

      "Most noble, firm and highly renowned, especially highly to be honoured lord domain-captain, office-petitioned lord, that the good bless the lord's high manorial court actions and everything may go well in the end, we the end-named wish from our hearts. And his sternness will doubtless not be unaware what recently took place between us and Christoph Froembder in addition to his brother here, namely it was three years ago, at the time of the then dead corn-clerk, Krumbholtze, concerning then annually payable demesne-grain, an error took place of the following sort. For when the corn-clerk who succeeded the dead Krumbholtz demanded payment of the demesne-grain, all sorts of errors were found in the villages of the manor, partly it was already carted away from the dead Krumbholtz, partly it was still standing, for which reason both the communities and the new corn-clerk were rendered totally confused. But after the time approached, and our community brought together the demesne-grain the then appointed village headman George Augsten asked the corn-clerk (because error was taking place everywhere) and he Georg Augsten himself did not know what remained for our community, how it was with our community, and how much was to be carted away, therefore he demanded corn for 1 year and oats for 2 years and we ran ourselves apart from that untroubled, when approximately 1 bushels less 1 pair of mill-grains remained over, in that every year the community had not brought the same in so very exactly. But in several weeks the said corn-clerk came and said that 1 additional bushels of corn, according to his register, was outstanding; we were also soon willing and ready to pay the same, and to deliver it to the proper place. Only the corn-clerk said that his accounts were cancelled and he had been given proper receipt for this, also the already-mentioned bushel of corn in addition to other defects set down in his register had been replaced and made good, if we wished therefore to give him for this a fodder-measure of oats or something that would be up to us, but because we made difficulties and were anxious that it might not be conducted that way, but rather be demanded from us in future, he assured us that he would demand nothing from us and immediately gave proper receipt for this, which however was mislaid out of inattention, for God forfend that we should show any disloyalty to the high count's bureaucrats, let alone to the interests of his excellency and graciousness, or that we should have ourselves soiled with such a triviality, if it had not taken place through error. Hereupon, now, the above-mentioned Georg Froembter, along with his brother, on various occasions, when resentment occurred had himself seen with this hair, and uttered loose speech, afterwards however made this good in all sorts of ways, of which it is not necessary to speak in detail. until now recently, the fire of conflict which was set by the devil truly raged, for when the baker along with his brother last Sunday before Ascenscion was summoned to the village court and warned to pay their outstanding fees on account of their conflict, both brothers showed themselves quite irrational, until finally it went so far that both had to be brought into obedience through instruction by the village court; in which time, the said baker uttered these irrational words and said, I lie here in the stocks as an honourable man, but if I had (saving reverence) stolen 1 bushel of corn, like Melcher's George, I would be a rogue, out of this there arose a high silence, and Christoph Schroeter asked both brothers who then had (saving reverence) stolen 1 bushel of corn, to which George Froembter answered, yes, George Austen held it indeed; whereupon Schroeter will pay a village court Groschens, but because the collective village court members heard it themselves, it was unnecessary and not requested, from this quite a rumour arose far and wide concerning us poor people because of the baker's and his brother's Unreined-in tongues, despite the fact that both brothers stated from the heart, both before the high count's manorial court and before the village court, that they did not know anything evil to say about us, as his sternness will remember, so that also on account of this corn most of our community have knowledge of this, and it was not somehow kept secret, in that we did not keep this back deliberately or evilly. And if in this we committed an error, George Froembter could have reported that, both to us and later to the high count's manorial court, at the very beginning when he carted the grain in here, if he had known and understood anything and everything better than we did. Only, an unreflective and slippery tongue speaks often against knowledge and desire, Yea, what is more, the error which was earlier committed by George Auster, and now forgiven by God and human beings and covered with the mantle of Christian love, was regulated by both brothers before all people defamatorily and irritatingly, and otherwise further to be silent revealed in an unchristian way, for which reasons there was sufficient cause to say, Oh, who stands, he may well watch out that he does not fall. But as this is an undertaken deed, which was revealed not Christianly but unchristianly, what can be concluded from this, therefore we beseech his sternnes the lord domain-captainn in service and obedience, for God's sake, to take us into the protection of his high office against these two conflictual and embroiling brothers, and to ordain in high tendency, that we may cultivate our own in future in rest and peace, so that somehow the brandywine of peace-breaking does not blow up such a fire that might evilly strike us poor people, who would gladly be restful. If in the judgment of his sternnes we are guilty of any mistake we will gladly replace it and make it good and in future show ourselves and conduct ourselves in a Christian and reputable comfort against all our persecutors to protection by your high office, we plead for your blessed well-being and remain, recommending God's mercy.\n",

And we will not let this conflict, which has recently arisen between us and Christoph FrÃ¶mbdern along with his brother here, in the least, namely three years ago when the then dead corn-clerk Krumbholtz, on account of the annual bush-cutting, took place, through the following articles, namely that the dead Krumbholtz's successor the corn-clerk succeeded, the bush-cutting was brought in, and all sorts of impropriety occurred in the manor in the villages, partly the dead Krumbholtz had been conducted away, partly it still remained, so that both the communities, as well as the new corn-clerk got very confused, but after the time drew near and our community collected up the bush-cutting, the then appointed Gerichtsverwalter George Austen, (because everywhere impropriety had occurred) and he Georg Austen himself did not know what our community remained, how it was with our community, and how much had to be conducted, he says that he must be summoned to Gerichten and upon being summoned the corn-clerk and said that there was 1 bushels of corn, according to his register, outstanding, we were also ready and willing to give it to him and to equip it to the proper place, but he the corn-clerk said his account was cancelled and he issued a proper receipt concerning this, also he had already replaced the outstanding bushels of corn along with other things listed in his register, we wished to give him a fodder of oats or something else, but because we were in difficult circumstances and were worried about it, so that it might not behave like this, but rather be summoned to us, he requested nothing from us, and immediately issued a proper receipt concerning this, which was however laid aside out of carelessness, for God to protect us from disloyalty to the countly bureaucrats and also to the gracious countly Excellency and graciousness of their interests, and to besmirch us with such a few, if it did not occur through impropriety. Hereupon the said, Georg FrÃ¶mbter along with his brother had on various occasions brought up the conflict, and uttered all sorts of bad speech, but finally, after the time drew near, and our community collected up the bush-cutting, the then appointed Gerichtsverwalter George Austen, on account of the conflict that occurred, and was a Christian, and also spoke badly of the two brothers, and did not speak well of people in general, and other things, so that it was sufficient to say that he was not standing, but he was not in the least a Christian, so that it would be sufficient to draw conclusions out of this, we seek here the gracious lord domain-captain's service in order to take the two conflict-prone and conflict-Inducing brothers in their high manorial court's protection and to ordain that in future we can live peaceably and in rest, so that perhaps the spirit of unrest may not burn up this conflict, which we would gladly be rid of, for our sake, although it is obvious that we have committed errors, we will much more gladly make them right and be good, and that we can conduct ourselves in future in a Christian and good way, and not follow our pursuers, the gracious countly Excellency and graciousness of their interests, and to show them that we are loyal to them, we ask that they be gracious and gracious.\n",

      "To whom it may concern with this certificate: since up to now between Andrea Bemrich, black-dyer in Friedland, on the one part, and then Andrea Bemrich the Younger, black-dyer in Steinau in Silesia, as the said Bemrich in Friedland's legitimate son, on the second part, concerning his, the Younger Bemrich's, inheritance share, which comes partly from a grandmother, namely Margaretha, Valten Kaulferses widow, and partly from his dead mother, there has been for some time conflict, that this, through the mediation of the princely manorial court of Friedland in the presence of the Below-named persons, has been completely agreed and abolished, as follows: since the honourable and learned Mr Fridericus gallus Notary public today, 23 May 1629, appeared in the princely manorial court of Friedland and showed a power of attorney Sighned by the Vogt and Schosser of the town court of Steinau, saying that Andreas Bemrich, citizen and black-dyer from Steinau, appeared in the Gericht there and said that he had an inheritance demand from his father in Friedland, Andrea Bemrich, member of the rat, but that he could not travel there right now, that he therefore gave power of attorney to this Friderico Gallo to act for him, whereupon the said Mr Mandatarius and actor asked that Andreas Bemrich in Friedland as defendant, and debtor be summoned in front of the princely manorial court, be informed of this and be held to just and fast solution and payment. who then upon summoning obediently appeared at the right time. And since report was collected, according to which concerning this inheritance-sharing, that already several years ago a correct agreement was reached and arranged before an honourable council of the town of Friedland, therefore the Gerichtsbuch is sought out and in it under the date 1612 Folio 1612 it was found, how after her death Margaretha Valten Kaulferss' s widow left various mobile and immobile property behind her, to which then there were three right natural heirs, in whose stead however there was an honourable guardianship, lord Christoff Zestermann, Andre Bemrich and Hiob Lohrman, all in Friedlandt and because the inheritance was quite large, therefore after the sharing-out had occurred to him Andre Bemrich respectively on account of his wife and also by succession onto his 4 children, namely Andreas, Cyriacus, Christianus and Maria, there come 311 Schocks 16 Groschens among this inheritance share however was included a piece of arable field beside the Holenstein, which the 3 above-named heirs equally shared, the same was assessed at 230 Schocks, of which as a third share Andrea received a piece assessed at 76 Schocks 40 Groschens and because afterwards the one piece of arable field was sold again, he Pemrich bought the same likewise for the best interests of his children to his previous piece. And when on account of this inheritance which came from Margaretha Kaulferss, Andrea Bemricht with his 4 children from his first marriage agreed, he had promised before an honourable council of the town of Friedland to pay each child 76 Schocks 40 Groschens for this, under which however no child until today except for the daughter Maria has been paid off and satisfied. After his first wife's death, however, he once again agreed in front of an honourable council with his children on account of their maternal share, and for this made over and promised to pay to each child 76 Schocks, so that thus each child for his inheritance share, so partly as said emanating from the grandmother and the other part from their mother, had to demand from their father 151 Schocks 40 Groschens and this inheritance demands also now Mandatarius and actor lord Fridiericus gallus Notary public on behalf of his client Andrea Bemricht black-dyer in Steinau, which the Oft-mentioned Andrea Bemrich senior in Friedland is demanded and commanded to pay. But since Bemrich as debtor admittedly acknowledged this debt (as it is contained in the Gerichtsbuch), and also found himself obliged to pay the same, nevertheless he very movingly brought forward, that at every time as befits a loyal father he watched, and day and night was working, to look after his children well, also through God's blessing and the labour of his hands, sorrow and effort, he obtained a piece of bread and brought it in front of himself, therefore he at the time at the sharing-out of the maternal share, when everything was in boom and good situation, he saw with his children of first marriage more toward the then present good times than on the Unhoped-For following bad times, and thus considered his children with an honourable maternal share, but since through the many military marches and quartering of soldiers, and then the generally difficult and to this day still enduring contributions, he came into very great, irretrievable harm to his livelihood, to such an extent that it is entirely impossible for him to equip his 3 sons with such a large funds, therefore he asked the princely manorial court most Obediely in hoc Passu to derive a medium between him and his children, so that he may both satisfy them in their Legimitate right but also he may as an old aged man provide himself with the necessities, and since this his complaint is not hidden, but rather quite notorious, known to town and country, also to every man, therefore the above mentioned lord Mandataria and Actori Fridrich Gallo was told this in justice, also finally through the following necessary persuasion pro and Contra it was mediated and sentenced so far, that he Andre Gembrich shall pay each of his 3 sons, Andrea, Cyriaco and Christiano, for the mentioned grandmother's and maternal share, the 151 Schocks 40 Groschens, shall pay them 126 Schocks 6 Groschens 4 2/3 denarius, when he thus promised with hand and mouth in the following way to effect and set in work, firstly his dyery in front of the town his son Cyriaco has purchased it for 600 Schocks, when he purchaser shall pay in cash on next St Bartholomew's 300 Schocks, from this cash money he asks to pay each son of his first marriage 50 Schocks second he will cede to the 3 sons the 2 arable fields beside the Holenstein which Origially emanated from the grandmother's inheritance and as said above cost 153 Schocks 20 Groschens, and in equal parts clear them to his sons, each share comes to 51 Schocks 6G 4 2/3 denarius Thirdly he wishes on the deadline of St. Bartholomew's 1630 to the son Andrea Gemrich in Steinau to pay 25 Schocks infallibly, also to agree with the other two thus that no further complaint comes in, so that thus each son for his share shall be given 126 Schocks 6 Groschens 4 2/3 denarius which points and articles then the Mandatorio and Actori Friderico Gallo, as also Andrea Bemricht as debtor, have thus accepted, to keep them firmly, not broken, in good belief, now or in future not to speak, act or do against them, in any way, not doubting that the other 2 sons, Cyriaco and Christiano, shall be likewise accepting it when they are on the spot, and will approve of it.

      "Since when on the 20th of June of this currently running year 1650 the lord brothers von Schwanns once again appeared against lord Melchior von Gersdorff, lord Christian Weygell von Weygelsdorff Vnndt Mertzdorff, as the von Schwanns' s requested auxiliary, says that the two lord brothers von Schwanns appear, and do not doubt that it will be known to the praiseworthy manorial court, how on account of proof, a claimed debt-Demand remained hanging, now because the true state of affairs can be found in the Amts-books and minutes, they render thanks very obediently for the manorial court's communication, if they have nothing other to put forward than a Testament, which was set up here at the praiseworthy town court in Friedland, this is a totally baseless foundation, since human desires are changeable as long as they live, and it also emerges and can be see besides, that the lady Testatrix made a different disposition two years later, and the then interim domain-captain here, Christoff Horn, not only ceded 100 Thlr from her debt-Demand, but also according to a council Bekentnis and attestation here actually Tradiert him the debt Verschreibung, and transferred it to him, concerning the claimed obligation, it was only an empty Scarte, which was prepared counter to the fief-law, also counter to the PrÃ¤gerische Canzley Nottull, and also without consent from the manorial authority, such that the original here states in detail; from which is to be seen, that almost nine Erbherrn have existed in this time, but they have no consent to show from any of them, for which reason the complaining party should provide itself with better proof, and not Litigate with such temerity, not detain minor orphans from their manor of Hermsdorf, not deteriorate the same, and not tire the praiseworthy count's manorial court with this, on top of which according to the Bohemian national ordinance it is held to be a Drimen Lobles Maiestatis when one does not let oneself be stated to by the same law, but rather Consorts with the enemies of the holy Roman Emperor, such that the manorial court minutes proves this, that he set himself into the manor and without the knowledge and will of the manorial authority practised counter to law in the manors of minor orphans, such that then the lord brothers von Schwanns protest against this great injury, that previously an attempt was made actually to involve them in an Actionem Iniuriarum, and do not admit that in the presence of the enemy attempted to get the manor of Hermsdorf, ask for this reason the count's manorial court that they will bring forward the minutes unburdened and have it consulted, how it came to this public lack of basis to their great insult, for which reason jure Reconuentionis they justly have to initiate a counter-Complaint, and ask, because through this they have been brought into irreversible injury, that the praiseworthy manorial court will instruct the Othe Rparty, that they shall pay them the damages, expenses, and deterioration, and because also in the mean time various contracta Simulata have been set up, to abolish them as an, and to annul them, beside which they then implore and appeal to the praiseworthy manorial court, Reseving all legal Nottulln. Hereupon answers lord Johann Frentzell, Notarius Publicus, on behalf of lord Melchior von Gersdorff, and reports, the von Gersdorffs had had to learn with amazement how now the lord brothers von Schwanns are taking it into their heads to take exception with such Wide-Ranging-Ness to their clear letter and seal, once again, and because especially this severe accusation occurred during this, that the complainant von Gersdorff had corresponded with the enemy, whereby he, if it were true, would justly have fallen into a Cassae Meiestatis, therefore he wishes, as an honourable, blameless knight, to take this to heart and mood here in Loco Judicy and immediately, to pursue angrily and vindicate with hoped-for Protestation against such insults Debito Modo, now since this conflictual case rests in in Terminis Transactionis, Cuius Tanta EST UIS et Natura Vt cum Semel Consentu Partirem Perfecta EST, Neq Patientia Partium, NEC Rescripto Principus Neq sub Praesent. Specierum Benuo Reportarum Rescindi Sohnt C. 1619. (de Transactionibus P. And in clear, bright matters all dispute is unnecessary and Otiose, therefore von Gersdorff must humbly request the count's manorial court that it will rest, hear from the lord brothers von Schwanns, whether that, which they agreed to then in the presence of their Beistaende and kin on both sides, and thankfully accepted, they will also now honourably, nobly, as befits knights, comply with, or however the said von Gersdorf leave it up to the highly-Drawn praiseworthy manorial court's decision whether he should not rather protect the above-mentioned agreement instead of making him lose his debt-Demand, Obiter only adds this, but totally not waiving his rights, von Gersdorff says that the Successu Temporis especially the bequeathed or gifted 100 Thlr from the lady Testatrix his demand is precisely included in this amount, also likewise at the agreement which occurred was agreed along with everything, and consequently came to him to pay, thus wishes no further to trouble the count's manorial court with words, but rather to take comfort in the protection of the same and the exercise of rights, asking for this highest possiblity. Replicando answers von Weygell, the lord brothers von Schwanns have learned in what way lord Gersdorff up to this date still seeks to steer himself according to the claimed agreement, now any debt at all must previously be properly proven, since if the begining is not well-Based then the end can also not have any consequences, since the debt in itself was a silent debt, for the prescribed time has passed nearly Fourteenfold, this debt-certificat was set up without arrangement of the consent of the manorial court, and counter to the running of the vassal-law, since no-one is allowed to enter into debts without the consent of the manorial court, therefore it is null and void, the last contract was admittedly sealed by one of the lord brothers, but he did not have any proper power of attorney from the eldest, for in the national ordinance it is clearly provided that the mandate of someone who is absent must be not only sealed by the principal but also confirmed by the Town-court in the same locality where he is dwelling, which however is not found to be true in this case, with with the last agreement was written up with the explicit condition of consent from the manorial authority, which condition however is not present here, thus also there comes to the spot of the brothers von Schwanns, the exception non Numeratus Pecuniae et Erroris, for which reason because in the mean time the claimed debt-certificate has been found, therefore it is regarded by them on account of the Numerousness of the lacks and Nullities, as a Nouum Emergens and to them also the legal means that are being used justly are regarded by them as an exception, on top of this 700 Reichstalersr were dunned and it now turns out that 100 Reichstalersr on it have already been paid, and they had nonetheless let themselves be introduced into the manor for the entire sum, even though Horn had never dunned or complained concerning his debt. The von Gersdorffs answer, the von Schwanntzes' grandfather, who had become pledge for this debt, was at that time himself domain-captain and thus there was consent enough, the 100 Reichstalersr which Horn claims, they were obliged to make good to him, they wish also on that account to represent the von Schwanns.\n",

      "Since on 20 June of this current year 1650 the lord brothers von Schwann appeared once again, lord Christian Weygell von Weygelsdorf and Mertzdorf, as the von Schwann's appointed representative, said that the two lord brothers von Schwanns appear, and do not know that it is well-known in the manorial court that the intended debt-demand is, because the female testatrix has already made a different disposition 2 years ago, and the interims domain-captain here at that time did not only cede to her the 100 Talers that he was demanded, but also according to a Rathbeschluss and attestation here liquidated the debt to him, the claimed obligation was only a mere Lehre Scarte, which was counter to the Lehensrecht, also counter to the Prague imperial law, and was also completed without the consent of the manorial court, such that the original here says that almost nine hereditary lords in this period were present, but no single one of them had consent, for which reason they complain that they should be able to make fast with the evidence, and not let them dispute it, the manor of Hermbsdorf which is still occupied is not deterred, and the manorial court shall deter it, according to the Bohemian national law, which in this matter is held to be a crime against the gracious majesty, if one does not let oneself be bound by the same law, but rather gives way to the Fendish, so that the manorial court minutes prove this in good detail, and without the knowledge and will of the manorial court acts unjustly against the minor orphan in Hermbsdorf, which the lord brothers von Schwanns protest against this great defamation, that previously they wanted to be dragged into an action of defamation, and did not admit that the manor of Hermbsdorf was affected by the presence of the enemy, for which reason they ask the manorial court to bring forward the minutes unburdened, for they would otherwise be forced to practice this unjustly, but because the conflict lies in Terminis transactionis, which is such that it is perfect according to consent of the parties, and patientia partium and Rescriptum Principus and Praesentem Specierum Benuo Reportarum Sont C. 1619. (Concerning the transactions and in the clear Heller case all Disputation is not necessary and odious, therefore von Gersdorff asked the countly manorial court in service to hear the von Gebrudern von Schwanns, whether they would accept the agreement that was made with them in the presence of their, on both sides, and also accept it now as an honourable and noble thing for a Ritterleuthen, or whether they would set aside the said von Gersdorff's written recognition, which was obtained by the said von Gersdorff, but which was not valid according to the manorial law, which was also not valid according to the Prager imperial law, but also without the consent of the manorial court, which however does not apply here, and also the von Gebrudern von Schwanns, the exception non Numeratus pecuniae et erroris, for which reason because between the intended debt-letter was found, and therefore they were dunned for 700 Reichstalers, and it is currently that already 100 Reichstalers have been paid on it, and they would also have had it transferred into the manor, but the horn did not demand or complain about his debt, the von Gersdorff answer, the lord Schwantz Grosvatter who became pledge for this debt, was himself domain-captain at that time and thus consent was sufficient, the 100 Reichstalers which von Gersdorff claims, they are obliged to make good to him, also they will have the von Schwanns represented.\n",

Since the kinship was not all gathered together, they were summoned to the count's manorial court chancellery on 10 Jan 1782, and they also all appeared. And were asked whether they might have reached an agreement, which they answered however with no. Therefore they were informed of the manorial presentation: 1. admittedly it was just that the father's will should stand, because it was to be suspected that those who were not mentioned in the father's will probably had received their share in a just division 2. Hans Michel and Hans Christoff were allocated the division of the smallholding, also now this was assessed to them for a very small sum namely 100 Schocks 3. It was not feasible to grant their petition because they were located in different villages, that they could divide, but rather the board-mill-days had to remain together in the village, and could be divided at most into 1/2 and 1/4 days. Additionally the manorial provision and declaration occurred, that the 1 1/2 board-mill-days should fall after the mother's death to the heirs living in Weisbach, and namely shall be paid by Elisabeth on the Lower board-mill 1/2 day, Anna Rosina 1/2 day there, Veronica on the village headman's mill 1/4 day, and Anton on the village headman's mill 1/4 day, for these board-mill-days.\n",

Since the relatives are not all present then which were summoned on the 10th of January 1782 in the countly manorial court, which also all collectively appeared. They were asked whether they had ever agreed, but they answered no, therefore they were told the manorial court's decision: 1. It is just that the paternal inheritance should be shared out in the fief-tenancy, because it is thought that those who have this inheritance in the fief-tenancy have been overlooked in the will, after all it is assumed that they have more property there than what is listed in the will. 2.
