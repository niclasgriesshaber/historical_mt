Now since this is totally and entirely not to be permitted, therefore hereby my very serious manorial court's command to you Schultheissen and sworn-man, is that, on pain of highest punishment, you shall exercise good supervision and attention, so that not a single one of the serfs who have absconded from a community, shall be issued with the least thing, whatever it might be, excluding nothing, but rather you will pay attention and make arrangements so that the grass, future grain, and all the like shall be sold or leased in a good way to someone, and the money from this devoted and used for the Anlaagen and contributions, so that the serfs who are still left over, may not be so heavily burdened and pressed. For further security of this however, you will in addition and similarly, keep a proper account and list, so that one can in future know what one and another thing was used for, I rely on your ensuring that this occurs, and you have to pay attention to this to protect yourself from harm, occurred in Friedlandt manorial court, 4 Jul 1651\n",

Stein MooÃŸ, and 35 pieces of Imperial and Ferdinand Talers, therefore he ran to the neighbours and complained about this, asked them, if one or another person knew anything about this, that they might be helpful to him. During this investigation, he found out so much and obtained news that Christ. IHausman in Raspenaw, was exchanging such varieties of old money, for which reason he had him spoken to by himself and by others, and he did not deny it, but when he was summoned into the manorial court he admitted that in the autumn of 1630 he was in the hills and came across the money, and took 104 Talers of it, but when he was asked what he was doing in the hills, he had not been able to answer anything more than that one was always having things to do in the hills, which leads to the conclusion that he had deliberately followed Tschidel and thus had found out. The said HauÃŸman however reports further that after the new year of this year 1631, although which day he did not actually know, he had stuck 88 Reichstalers by night in through Hans Tschidell's window, the remaining 16 Talers he had consumed. Tschiedel however does not admit anything more than that he had found 46 Talers, asks therefore because Augsten took one away, to help him to it that he also pay him the others. Austen insists once again upon it, that it had been 88 Reichstalers, now whether it was the servants, or whoever else had taken from it, he does not know. And because he Haussmann excuses himself on the grounds that he did not take the money wholly, saying thereby that he speculates, because Hans Tschidel's son Christof before his wedding had dressed himself very dignifiedly and fancily, that he might have received some of this money. Upon this he Augsten was given 8 days for consideration, such that he shall report back in then and make detailed report, also testify concerning what he has to bring forward in detail, and so that this shall certainly occur, Georg RÃ¶ssell village headman in Raspenaw is pledge for him. On 11th April the village headman Georg RÃ¶ssel delivered Christof Austen in here, who, because he did not want to say anything who had taken the rest, was held in arrest. Since the said Hausman was held in arrest until 23 May, and had very little to his own best interest, therefore both village headmen in Raspenaw and Mildenaw interceded for him, so that he would be released from imprisonment, and are as pledges to deliver him back when it is demanded, and thus it was dismissed.\n",

Ferdinand Thll, therefore he complained to the neighbours, saying that if anyone knew anything about this he would help him, in the course of this questioning he learned from Christ. Hausman in Raspenaw, who deals in such old money, for which reason he had him spoken to by himself and others, who denied it, but when he was summoned into the manorial court he admitted it, that in the autumn of 1630 he was in the Geburge and came across the money and took 104 Thll from it, but when he was questioned about what he had to do in the Geburge he could only say that there was always something to do in the Geburge, conclusion that he had Tschidel with diligence and thus learned knowledge. The said HauÃŸman however reports further that in this current year 1631 on a day which he does not know, Hans Tschidell stuck Hans Austen's money back in his window at night, the remaining 16. Thll. Tschiedel however does not admit anything more than that he found 46. Thll. Asks therefore that because the Augsten took it away, that he be helped to it, Austen still insists that it was 88. Reichstalers, whether it was taken by the servants or by anyone else he did not know. And because he Hausmann excuses himself that he did not take the money altogether, reporting that he thinks that Hans Tschidel's son Christof dressed very expensively and fashionably for his wedding, that he might have got some money from it. Upon this he Augsten is given 8 days' consideration, that he shall report back then and report in detail, also what he has to put in one and another place, and this shall certainly happen, pledge for him is Georg RÃ¶ssell village headman in Raspenaw.

      "1. last Friday, the 29th, they came up to the castle of Friedland in a large number, did not make an appointment beforehand with the manorial court, but rather ran straight up into the Upper Castle, walked below the lord's room with strong speech, did not spare the lord who was still at his rest, and showed disrespect thereby to the lord, the lord takes this very much amiss, not because of the petitions they submitted, but because of their offensive gathering which was improper for obedient serfs, since if they have something to petition about, they could have done it through a smaller number of persons, and submitted it to the lord his grace or the to the manorial court, the lord warns them not to do this in future or they will be punished. 2. But concerning their petitions and grievances in detail, and especially concerning BÃ¶hmisch Neustadt, the lord his grace issues decision, that they are well aware that the NeustÃ¤dt have informed the lord national officers of their freedoms and favours, that they may serve beer and wine, and have it fetched, wherever they like, and may make use of this freedom in all ways like other mining towns, and you will also remember, how difficult it was in the oath of allegiance of the NeustÃ¤dters, what kind of threatening words they allowed to be heard from themselves against the FriedlÃ¤nders, and on this they pleaded, because they are poor people, and the mining there is poor and small, not to rob them of their freedoms, and treat them counter to justice. 3. The tavern and drink serving in Arnsdorf, and the rights of it there, are at present mortgaged for a certain sum of money to the lord his grace, and therefore the lord his grace is well entitled to make use of the said right because of the money he has spent on it. The other team which does not have the right to put out their tavern, to force village headmen to serve their beer, the lord his grace does not see how they could with justice be forced to do this. 4. the lord his grace's tavern however concerning this the Friedlanders privileged them to serve all their beer, the lord his grace was not aware, much less the lord his grace's command, to serve in it the beer of the lord his grace or the lady countess, but whoever let it happen in knowledge, it shall not be permitted further but rather abolished, and also the drink serving of the field-wards shall no longer be permitted.\n",

For if they have anything to bring forward to his grace through petition, they should do it through a small number of persons, their entitlement and petitions should be handed in to his grace himself or to the manorial court appointed to this, and because his grace's mildness and what was previously granted to them by his grace they have not let it remain to them, but rather only misused it, his grace warns them, in future to refrain from such disrespect, so that on the other hand something else might not be their lot. 2. Their petitions and complaints which they handed in, but in detail and especially concerning the BÃ¶chemischen Neustadt, his grace gives them the decision that they are well aware that Neustetter reported their freedoms and privileges equally to the lord land-officer, that they serve beer and wine and have it fetched, where it is advantageous and fitting for them, and they can make use of it in all ways like other mining-places. They will also remember how difficult the swearing-in of the Neustetter was, what they heard and learned against the FriedlÃ¤nders, and they asked up here because they were poor people, that they might not be robbed of their mining, and it would be counter to justice. 3. The village tavern and serving in Arnsdorf, and its rights currently the manorial authority insists on a certain sum of money, for which reason his grace is entitled to make use of this right on account of the money they have paid. The other group which is not entitled to serve taverns are not to force the village headman to serve their beer to his grace, as this is not just, and the manorial authority will not command it. 4. But the manorial authority has privileged the Friedlanders to serve their beer, his grace does not know much less his grace's command that the lord his grace or the lady countess his grace's beer be served in them, but if it occurs without knowledge it shall not occur any more but rather be abolished, and also the tavern-serving of the SchÃ¼zen shall not be permitted in future.\n",

      "Andreas Friederich, goldsmith, along with his daughter, who is crazy in her understanding, complains against the boardcutter in Friedland, that last Monday which was the 29 July, was walking out of the town drunk on beer, she the goldsmith's daughter was beside the board-mill, he went to her and said, thou are a fine lass, gave her good words, afterwards pressed her down on the Saw-Spann, slept beside her, when she was asked whether the boardcutter, because he was somewhat drunk, had fallen down again beside her and gone to sleep soon, she said no, but rather he had opened up his trousers and lain on top of her (saving reverence) taken his thing and stuck it in her thing, at the same time also said, there were many boys on the mill-court, who saw this, now because they were summoned to the lord Richter, they said before him that they had not set eye on the lass on that day. Now because the boardcutter was questioned about this all by the Gericht quite hard and severely, because he heard the complaint from the plainants himself, he excused himself in the highest terms and insisted that he was not guilty of this deed, and besides this said that if he were guilty of such a deed and were to be proved to have done it, his gracious manorial authority should not spare him but rather punish him severely, asks, because this touches on his honour and propriety, that he be taken into just protection. Hereupon both parties are summoned into the manorial court and asked further about these facts. The following was brought forward by both parties: the boardcutter brings forward, on Monday 8 days ago it occurred thus, that the castle-miller asked him, because he had sold a house, that he would help drink at the leasing-Sale, which occurred at the lord Richter's, which he did, when they were finished, he went home in the evening, and lay down to his rest, and in the morning early got about about 4 o'clock and there were lots of people standing on the Michl Hof, the Wednesday after that his? daughter-in-law had gone into the town, she encountered the goldsmith's second daughter at die Adam Grosmannin, and she said to her what news can I tell you, your father-in-law has lain with my sister, thereupon his? daughter-in-law asked where it occurred, she answered below the board-mill on the Saw-Spann, she further said I will tell this to my father-in-law as soon as I get home thereupon she answered, be silent about it, my father and mother have taken council about this that they will wait for 4 weeks, when the 4 weeks are over they will see whether she has been damaged, if she hasn't been damaged they will remain silent. Now when his? Daugther-in-law told him this, he sent his wife to the goldsmith to have her asked whether she admitted these words, his wife brought back that she die Goldschmiedin was complaining to heaven that he had thus damaged her daughter, thereupon he sent Hans Leibner to her, who brought him in answer that his the goldsmith's daughter was supposed to have uttered shameful words about him in the presence of her parents, so that he got angry about this, hereupon he went to the lord Richter and asked him for advice thereupon they were summoned on the second day and heard, and when the lord Richter heard both sides, he seriously asked the lass where she had met him, that they had come together, she answered, on the bleaching-ground, further asked where he had led her, she answered below the board-mill on the Saw-Span he asked her further, what he had further done to her, he had blocked her bed, the lord Richter asked her further, what he had done to her, she answered, he had taken his thing out of his trousers and stuck it in her thing the lord Richter had further asked because so many boys were there, whether no-one had seen it, she said yes she knew those who had seen it, he asked who they had been, she answered Christoff Rudeiger's, also who further had seen it, she answered Christoff Floeckens. Now he had dwelt for 23 years and no-one would be able to say of him that he had ever used an fornicationige word about women, daughters, or maids, asks that he be taken into just protection, also insofar as he be found guilty of the deed, he asks that he be punished according to the severity of the law, he will patiently endure it if he has deserved it.\n",

      "The village headman in Ruckersdorff brings forward, he walked in here a fortnight ago last Monday, wanted to get information from lord domain-captain about how he should do it with the soldiers, then he encountered the village headman in Schonwalda beside Knoblochen in the lane, wished him good morning, asked him where he was going, he said he wanted to go into the manorial court and ask what the situation was with the soldiers, he answered he didn't have to, he had already been in the manorial court, he would tell him it, then he turned around with him, down the lane said to him, Godfather, yesterday you did not do right, along with the clerk, he asked why, what was it, I commanded the clerk, 8 days ago yesterday, to come up here and write up the taxes, then he was supposed to write up a purchase in Schoenwalda, and the clerk had forgotten to do it, afterwards the second Sunday he sent his servant down there to Schonwalda and had him say to the clerk that he should go forth so that he could write up the taxes, then the clerk had it said to him through his maid, didn't he have a mouth so that he could have told me it, the village headman in Schonwalda had forbidden him to go, or he should never again write for him in the village tavern. 14 days previously in Ruckersdorf he had also had a purchase, and he had commanded the schoolmaster, when he was finished, he should go to Schonwalda and write up the taxes, this he thus told to the village headman, they thus went with one another into the wine-cellar, now when they came into the wine-cellar, they drank with one another, afterwards they thought about the pastor in Schonwalda, the village headman there said he always gives me stings, soon I will stop going to church, then he said to him he should not do this, he was also a poor sinner. finally he said they were always on top of one another, the pastor had said about him that he had had a confession-chair built for him, he can call it a cheese-basket, he should not remain long in the church, than the Seiger in the vicarage, besides he said he had the Prae, thereupon he the village headman in Ruckersdorf said he did not have the Prae, but rather the lord his grace. Thereupon Friederich von Kyaw said, you are godfathers and neighbours, let it be, and drink a toast to one another, thereupon the village headman in Ruckersdorf said, I have absolutely no anger with him, thereupon the village headman of Schonwalda drank to him, hereupon the old Schoesserâ€™s wife/widow came into the wine-cellar, wanted to talk to him, he stood up and talked to her for perhaps half an hour, likewise drank up one drink alongside, now when he had finished talking he came back to the table, said I and my clan have dwelt in Schoenwalda for some 200 years, and thou shalt Vulua be caught with many, thereupon he answered not a Meidt I am an honourable man, thereupon he said, thou art a villain not a Mendt, I am an honourable man, thereupon he said, thy father was burnt, thereupon he said but he lies buried in Schonwalda, then Friederich von Kyaw said, hey what are you doing, the old village headman lies buried in Schonwalda, the village headman however did not do anything else besides, so that he thus did not know if he meant it seriously or not. After 3 days he went to the tavernkeeper and asked him for advice, what he should do, he must complain about it either in the Gericht or in the manorial court, and whether he had also heard the words, then the tavernkeeper said it is good that you come yourself, I wanted now to go to the magistrate and report it to him, but because you come yourself, you can report it yourself, thereupon several citizens said he should first send in advance with a couple of men whether he admitted the words, perhaps he had been jesting, which he did, sent to him thus, then he had it said to him that he had no anger against him and did not know what he had said, after all he had walked to the grave with his father, next Tuesday 8 days ago they came together at Heinrich Seideln's then the village headman in Schonwalda had drunk one to him, gave him his hand and asked for forgiveness, then he said to him, if he had not said one thing he would be perfectly satisfied with him, namely that his father had been burnt, thereupon he said he had not meant him but rather someone who had passed through Friedland, and had been burnt in Friedeburg thereupon he walked up here and reported it to the lord domain-captain. The village headman in Schonwalda reports: when they had walked out of the church he and the village headman in Ruckersdorf had spoken with one another about the soldiers, also left it how they would have it with one another, afterwards when they had finished he said to the clerk, come down there is a bad purchase to write down, when he came in and wrote up the purchase the village headman of Ruckersdorf sent 2 messengers down and had them say to the clerk, he should but come and write up the taxes, thereupon he told him to go but along with this asked the clerk whether it had been told to him in advance, and he answered nothing had been said to him, thereupon he said to him he might go, if he would only finish up the purchase, then he would write down the purchase and take the fee, whereby it thus remained. Now after they had met in the street in Friedland, this was repeated. Also the confession-chair was thought of, that he had called it a cheese-basket, which he did not admit, that he had called it thus, the village headman in Schonwalda said that they had just as much right in the church as they did, and no-one wished to take it away from them, thereupon he the village headman in Ruckersdorf said, I am just as much an honourable man as another, then he the village headman of Schonwalda said, previously a man was carted through Friedlant who was afterwards burnt in Friedeberg now when he was sent to by the village headman of Ruckersdorf, he answered, how should he have said this, he had after all walked to the grave with his father, and besides said they were after all blood-kin with one another, if he defamed him then he had defamed himself, and knew nothing of him, also they both afterwards went up to the castle with one another and bought the four horses, afterwards drank the lease-purchase with one another, sat beside one another. Then Paper-Caspar began saying, there sit the biters, one Menge between the evil village headmen, thereupon the village headman of Ruckersdorf began to say, lord godfather, how did you mean it, the village headman of Schonwalda, I mean it well, we will do well with one another, thereupon they drank to one another again, remained sitting with one another, and afterwards parted silently and went home. The tavernkeeper is questioned about this, reports: several weeks ago the two village headmen had come into the wine-cellar, they must have got into conflict sometime before in the lane, they had mentioned the church- or confession-chair, but they had not defamed each other seriously, after that Old Schosserâ€™s wife/widow came in, thereupon the village headmans of Schonwalda stood up and sat himself to Schosserâ€™s wife/widow at another table, and thus talked to one another, what it was he did not know. Now when he stood up he walked over to the table, called the village headman in Ruckersdorf a liar several time, who asked that he not do that, finally he called him a villain, the one from Ruckersdorf defamed him with the same name, thereupon the village headman of Schonwalda said that his were burnt, then the tavernkeeper said to him, I cannot remain silent about this, the next day the village headman of Ruckersdorf came and said that God pity us, what has my godfather done, how shall I act, thereupon he said, you must report it, if not I will do it myself, thereupon the village headman said he would himself report it into the manorial court, or to his grace, and thereby it thus remained. Sentence: since the village headman of Schonwalda attacked the village headman of Ruckersdorf in the wine-cellar with defamatory words, concerning which his grace, because the village headmen shall provide a good example to other serfs, is ungraciously displeased, therefore his grace had the village headman of Schoenwalda as the initiator set in the tower with the explicit command that he shall not be released from this imprisonment until he has paid his grace 50 Talers fine, likewise Jacob Tobinger the tavernkeeper is stuck in the lock-up because he did not report this conflict to the magistrate in Friedland right away, shall likewise not be released from prison until he has paid 10 Schocks fine. The tavernkeeper paid 10 Schocks on 11 may 1619.\n",

Now when they came into the wine-tavern, they talked with one another, afterwards when they were finished they said to the clerk come down and write a bad purchase, when he came and wrote the purchase, the village headman of Ruckersdorf sent two messengers down and had the clerk told that he should come down and write down the taxes, he said to them to go, but asked the clerk if he had also been told this previously, he answered he had not been told anything, then he said to him if he would go he would write the purchase and take the fee with it, and thus it remained. After they had gone to Friedland on the road, this was said again, also the Beichtstuel was mentioned, that he had named him a cheese-basket, which he did not admit, that he had named him that, then the village headman of Schonwalda stood up and sat down at a different table, and thus spoke with one another, what it was he could not know. Now when he stood up he went to the table and called the village headman of Ruckersdorf a villain several times, who pleaded with him not to do it, finally he called him a villain, the village headman of Ruckersdorf called him the same, the village headman of Schonwalda said the Siegen were burned, then the tavernkeeper said I must not remain silent about this, the next morning the village headman of Ruckersdorf came and said God help me what has my Gefatter done, how am I supposed to do it, then he looked, you must report it or I will do it myself, then the village headman said he would report it himself into the manorial court or complain to his grace, and thus it remained. Since the village headman of Schonwalda attacked the village headman of Ruckersdorf in the wine-tavern with dishonouring words, for which reason their graces, because the village headmen are supposed to set a good example to the other serfs, take an ill view of this, therefore their graces had the village headman of Schonwalda set in the tower, with an explicit command that he should not be released from prison until this, he paid their graces 50 Talers in fine, likewise Jacob Tobinger the tavernkeeper was stuck in the lock-upn, the cause being that he did not immediately report this conflict and dispute to the magistrate in Friedland, likewise he was not released from prison until he paid 10 Schocks fine, on 11 May 1619 the tavernkeeper paid 10 Schocks.\n",

Response: Tomas GeiÃŸler, Friedrich Bischoff was at his place at daybreak, then four persons came at night, threw stones at him, ran at him for the hearing, so that Thomas GeiÃŸler offered to reach agreement.

GeiÃŸler had paid the expenses which went on them, as well as the expenses of the elders.

In the opposite, because Thomas GeiÃŸler offered an apology, but the accused, along with their parents, do not want to accept the agreement, they shall pay the expenses for the two GeiÃŸlers, and appeal against this to the village court.

      "Hans Pilz in CunnerÃŸdorff complains against Matz Pilzen, that the latter defamed him in the village court in Ringenhain, he had paid GÃ¶rge Brendeln a quarter of wheat, who had previously beaten him, and in doing so he had acted like a villain. Maz Pilz answers, he is harrassed everywhere by the Friedlanders, he has to pay something more than what anyone else has paid, that he ought not to do. village headman in Ringenhain gives testimony: Maz Pilz said that the Pilzes in Cunnersdorff are always rubbing ears to him, he should also pay wheat to the furrier, but he does not do this, he had also not caused it, who is a rogue, he remains a rogue, a villain, he makes no-one into a rogue. Matz Krause gives testimony: Matz Pilz said he did not want to hold Hans Pilz as a cousin, if he had done this and had given a quarter of wheat, but rather in this he had dealt as a villain. Christoff Richter gives testimony, if it were true that Hans Pilz had gifted the furrier with wheat, then he must indeed be a villain; he had not accused him of anything further. Marten Pilz gives testimony: if someone was not a villain, then he did not give a quarter of wheat, someone must be a rogue or a villain who let himself be beaten and on top of that gave wheat. Conclusion. It emerges from this whole case that Matz Pulz defamed Hans Pilzen for this reason, that he had given furrier Georg the wheat for blows, for if he had done this then he had in doing so dealt wrongly and like a villain; but Hans Pilz himself admits that the had given the furrier the wheat as an honorarium out of good friendship, concerning which can well be deduced out of this, that Matz PÃ¼lze's intention was not to defame him for this cause, but rather what he said, this occurred in general, and therefore both parties gave their hands to one another, that neither knows anything unjust to say about the other, and also vowed that each would live with the other peaceably by fine of 30 Schocks, and not think of this further.\n",

Thereupon he Sichelschmidt asked what was in there, and she answered, I will show you, and thereupon gave him a golden bracelet, saying you have daughters, would you not want to buy it, village headman (who keeps the court in Seidenberg) also has one. Upon this, he Sichelschmidt asked where they had got it from, whereupon she said, her husband and the village headman had carted into the malt, where they found this in a parcel on the Gorlichshaimer. Thereupon PÃ¼lz, who was in the barn, called to the village headman as his neighbour, who was greasing a wagon on his farm, with these words, godfather, do we want to sell the things, upon which the village headman answered: yes, we do want to sell it. But when he Sichelschmiedt asked how expensive, they said for 5 Schocks, thereupon he Sichelschmidt answered, it is too expensive for me, but if you want to bring it to Fridtlandt, then we can let the goldsmith see it, how much it is worth. And this was on a Wednesday. Upon this, PÃ¼lz said, next Saturday I will come to Friedtlandt to Brosius Wackern for shoes, and then I will bring them with me. When then he also came on the said day, he was however not at home. On the following Sunday early, the village headman came to him Sichelschmiden in front of his door on a horse and said, Jakob we have sold our things, one of them to the demesne man in Cunnerstorf, Bischoff, for which he gave us corn, and did not say anything further but rather rode into the town. This he Sichelschmidt afterwards recounted to the tailor, as well as others, but does not know what happened to the other one.\n",

Upon this he Sichelschmidt asked her where she got it, and she said her husband and Kretschmer had carted into the malt-house, there she found it in a Gorlichshaimer in a small sack. Thereupon PÃ¼lz who was in the barn called to Kretschmer as his neighbour, who was greasing a cart, on his farm, with these words, grandfather, we will sell the thing, to which Kretschmer answered, yes we will sell it. But when he Sichelschmidt asked how much, they said for 5 Schocks, thereupon he Sichelschmidt answered, it is too dear, but if you bring it to Friedland I will let the goldsmith see it and see how much it is worth.

Hereupon I, by virtue of the office I bear, commanded the said Gottfridt Richter according to recognition of justice, because he admits all this, and shall immediately pay the customs, thus Dittman was not a Verfahrer of the contraband, this burdened after him Richter, shall fully content Andreas Dittman and satisfy him in the outstanding debt.

Since von Miltitz's request was accepted as just, the lord creditors also let the deadline of 14 days pass by for bringing a capable purchaser to hand, and since the manor stands thus longer, neither the highest nor the national Obrigkheit will obtain anything from it, therefore von Miltitz will until further notice inspect the said manor by the manorial court here, and another decision will be made, hereby is secured by the manorial court that he shall remain with each and every grain, which he has cultivated in the manor counter to the leasing, and then harvests, in return for payment, either in natura, or by the collective lord creditors, in addition to proper satisfaction for all other verifiable losses, before this occurs, he shall not be bound to leave the manor or give it up, for greater security this is issued pro Recognitione.

The farm was not his any more, they should get their payment from the lady, and concerning all this all this time between the lady and von Haberlandt all sorts of contrarieties have arisen, so that von Haberland at the time of his paternal farm had cause to complain once again to him about paying, to step back from the village tavern, and to await his proper payment for what since that time various complaints and counter-reports have run back and forth, von Haberland refers to all this. And because von Haberland already on the well-mentioned her grace's command had deposited the 300 Schocks on 8th Dec 1617 into the manorial court, he von Haberland now asks our gracious lord his grace and this laudable manorial court to be gracious and gracious to him, to protect him with the once-issued decision and command, as is just, and conversely to instruct Christoff Sander once and properly so that he likewise complies with the issued decision in all points and words, also in addition to this to repay the many damages which Christoff inflicted on von Haberland, along with proper apology for uttered insults, hopes that this occurs justly\n",

But Albertinellus immediately began with impatience, saying he was not a town citizen, neither the manorial court nor the town court had anything to do with him, if he or his principal had something to complain of in law, one should render them all assistance, but insofar as FernandeÃŸ was to be spoken to about anything, they should seek it in front of his gracious lord Landes Haubtman Suchen, and he then immediately went away from there and would totally not take any position, therefore Zimmerman as well as the Richter ask for help and protection.\n",

      "Since Caspar Zimmerman bought several grains from the Welschen Conductoren, which amounted to 50 florins, for which he issued and gave him an obligation. But when Zimmerm. afterwards the Welchen were totally contented in the Gericht, which money Stephanus Albertinelli received into his hands, therefore Zimmerman demands his given obligation, which Stephanus however cannot exhibit, claiming that it was lost, for which reason he was issued with an Antapocha and Voided receipt in the Gericht under the Gerichts Siegell along with Albertinelli's signature, so that the obligation might be found in its original. And because previously Caspar Zimmerman bought several irons from the Welschen, which he also paid the Conductoren properly, each of them Albertinellus declared in the presence of the Richter in Friedtlandt and Job Zimmermans, and Hans Berntes, that Franciscus who was foreman in the hammer would, and would say under oath that he had cheated him Zimmerman for a Reichstalers. and that he was a villain he would prove and show with an oath. This occurred on the 7th of July. Now when he, as mentioned above, was summoned on the 14th of July to the hearing in the Gerichte, and however slipped into the parlour, he asked once again, what then did Caspar Zimmerman or his Gesellen desire (for the Gesellen already celebrated this defamation), he was told in answer that he should slip away a bit. Albertinellus immediately began to get angry, he was no burgher, he had nothing to do with either the manorial court or the Gerichte, if he or his principal had anything to complain about, he would help him, but insofar as they wanted to speak about the FernandeÃŸ, they should seek this with his grace the lord national domain-captain, and thus ran away from it totally and would not stand still. Thus Zimmerman and also the Richter ask for help and protection.\n",

Hereupon Nicol Knobloch as current Schuldtheis in Tzschirnhaus answers, that it was not without truth that several years ago he bought the village tavern there, but he had always thought that better times would come, whereby he could pay his creditors, but because on the said village tavern he has often and on many occasions lost everything that was his, such that however much he wished to do so he could not attain to the payment; now in the case that the creditors will leave him with the village tavern, he will pay out within 4 days from today 10 marks:, and afterwards every year 10 Ma.: until full satisfaction, also on account of paying-off of the first two deadlines provide sufficient guarantee; if however this cannot after all be the case, and they can obtain a better purchaser who will give them more from it, he would be well satisfied, he only asks the count's manorial court humbly to make interposition that he might keep his little bit of cattle, so that he might not totally go into the ground.

Hereupon Nicol Knobloch as the current Schulthess in Tzschirnhaus answers, that it was not without reason that he several years ago purchased the village tavern there, he had always intended that better times would come so that he could pay his creditors, but because he has often and frequently come around to the village tavern, so that he would gladly do so if he could, he has not been able to get to the payment, now if the creditors will let the village tavern lie, from this day on he will pay 10 M.: and afterwards every year 10 Ma.: until full satisfaction, also concerning payment of the first two installments provide sufficient pledges, but if it cannot be done and they can get a better purchaser who will give them more from it, he is well content, only asks that the count's manorial court through its interposition keep him from going totally to the ground.

      "Most noble, firm and highly renowned, especially highly to be honoured lord domain-captain, office-petitioned lord, that the good bless the lord's high manorial court actions and everything may go well in the end, we the end-named wish from our hearts. And his sternness will doubtless not be unaware what recently took place between us and Christoph Froembder in addition to his brother here, namely it was three years ago, at the time of the then dead corn-clerk, Krumbholtze, concerning then annually payable demesne-grain, an error took place of the following sort. For when the corn-clerk who succeeded the dead Krumbholtz demanded payment of the demesne-grain, all sorts of errors were found in the villages of the manor, partly it was already carted away from the dead Krumbholtz, partly it was still standing, for which reason both the communities and the new corn-clerk were rendered totally confused. But after the time approached, and our community brought together the demesne-grain the then appointed village headman George Augsten asked the corn-clerk (because error was taking place everywhere) and he Georg Augsten himself did not know what remained for our community, how it was with our community, and how much was to be carted away, therefore he demanded corn for 1 year and oats for 2 years and we ran ourselves apart from that untroubled, when approximately 1 bushels less 1 pair of mill-grains remained over, in that every year the community had not brought the same in so very exactly. But in several weeks the said corn-clerk came and said that 1 additional bushels of corn, according to his register, was outstanding; we were also soon willing and ready to pay the same, and to deliver it to the proper place. Only the corn-clerk said that his accounts were cancelled and he had been given proper receipt for this, also the already-mentioned bushel of corn in addition to other defects set down in his register had been replaced and made good, if we wished therefore to give him for this a fodder-measure of oats or something that would be up to us, but because we made difficulties and were anxious that it might not be conducted that way, but rather be demanded from us in future, he assured us that he would demand nothing from us and immediately gave proper receipt for this, which however was mislaid out of inattention, for God forfend that we should show any disloyalty to the high count's bureaucrats, let alone to the interests of his excellency and graciousness, or that we should have ourselves soiled with such a triviality, if it had not taken place through error. Hereupon, now, the above-mentioned Georg Froembter, along with his brother, on various occasions, when resentment occurred had himself seen with this hair, and uttered loose speech, afterwards however made this good in all sorts of ways, of which it is not necessary to speak in detail. until now recently, the fire of conflict which was set by the devil truly raged, for when the baker along with his brother last Sunday before Ascenscion was summoned to the village court and warned to pay their outstanding fees on account of their conflict, both brothers showed themselves quite irrational, until finally it went so far that both had to be brought into obedience through instruction by the village court; in which time, the said baker uttered these irrational words and said, I lie here in the stocks as an honourable man, but if I had (saving reverence) stolen 1 bushel of corn, like Melcher's George, I would be a rogue, out of this there arose a high silence, and Christoph Schroeter asked both brothers who then had (saving reverence) stolen 1 bushel of corn, to which George Froembter answered, yes, George Austen held it indeed; whereupon Schroeter will pay a village court Groschens, but because the collective village court members heard it themselves, it was unnecessary and not requested, from this quite a rumour arose far and wide concerning us poor people because of the baker's and his brother's Unreined-in tongues, despite the fact that both brothers stated from the heart, both before the high count's manorial court and before the village court, that they did not know anything evil to say about us, as his sternness will remember, so that also on account of this corn most of our community have knowledge of this, and it was not somehow kept secret, in that we did not keep this back deliberately or evilly. And if in this we committed an error, George Froembter could have reported that, both to us and later to the high count's manorial court, at the very beginning when he carted the grain in here, if he had known and understood anything and everything better than we did. Only, an unreflective and slippery tongue speaks often against knowledge and desire, Yea, what is more, the error which was earlier committed by George Auster, and now forgiven by God and human beings and covered with the mantle of Christian love, was regulated by both brothers before all people defamatorily and irritatingly, and otherwise further to be silent revealed in an unchristian way, for which reasons there was sufficient cause to say, Oh, who stands, he may well watch out that he does not fall. But as this is an undertaken deed, which was revealed not Christianly but unchristianly, what can be concluded from this, therefore we beseech his sternnes the lord domain-captainn in service and obedience, for God's sake, to take us into the protection of his high office against these two conflictual and embroiling brothers, and to ordain in high tendency, that we may cultivate our own in future in rest and peace, so that somehow the brandywine of peace-breaking does not blow up such a fire that might evilly strike us poor people, who would gladly be restful. If in the judgment of his sternnes we are guilty of any mistake we will gladly replace it and make it good and in future show ourselves and conduct ourselves in a Christian and reputable comfort against all our persecutors to protection by your high office, we plead for your blessed well-being and remain, recommending God's mercy.\n",

      "Well-noble, stern and highly-renowned especially highly-honour lord domain-captain, of the manorial court-cases of the lord his high office-branching lord, that the farms of the lord his high office-branching lord are blessed and all things go well for him, we the under-Enfiefed von Hertzen and it will not be without severe punishment what has recently occurred between us and Christoph FrÃ¶mbdern along with his brother here, namely 3 years ago at the time of the corn-clerk who is dead, Krumbholtz, concerning the annual SchoÃŸ grain-trading certain errors occurred, namely the corn-clerk who succeeded the dead Krumbholtz dunned the SchoÃŸ grain, all sorts of errors took place in the manor villages, partly the dead Krumbholtz had already been issued with it and partly it was still standing, therefore both the communities and also the new corn-clerk were quite confused, but after time had passed the communities brought the SchoÃŸ grain together and the then-appointed Gerichtsverwalter George Austen asked the corn-clerk (because all sorts of errors had occurred everywhere) and he Georg Austen himself did not know what our community was outstanding, how it was with our community, and how much there was to issue, therefore the said corn-clerk issued 1 bushels corn and 2 bushels of oats, and we did not worry about the remainder, except that 1 bushel corn less 1 Baar Metzen remained over, in that in each year the community did not bring it together so precisely. several weeks later the said corn-clerk came and said that there was still 1 bushel corn outstanding according to his register, we were immediately willing and ready to give it and bring it to the proper place, only the corn-clerk said his accounts were cancelled and he was properly Quittiret, he had also already replaced the said bushel corn along with others listed in his register as defects and made it good, we would therefore gladly give him a bushel oats or something, but because we were difficult and worried that it might turn out otherwise and in future we would be demanded from us, he said he didn't expect anything from us, and immediately issued proper receipt concerning this, but this was lost out of carelessness, so may God protect us from showing any disloyalty to the lord count's bureaucrats, let alone the strict excellency and grace in their interests, and not to sully us with such things, if it did not occur through error. Now on this the above-mentioned Georg FrÃ¶mbter along with his brother on various occasions, on pain of being taken into imprisonment, let it be known that they had nothing bad to say about us, and uttered dissolute speech, but again made it good in all sorts of ways, therefore there is no need to speak of it in detail, until recently recently, when the conflict fire flared up through incitement of the evil foe, namely when the baker along with his brother last Sunday before holy week summoned the Gerichten and dunned them for the Oft-mentioned affair concerning their conflict-Case, and they the two brothers proved quite UnvernÃ¼nfftig, until it finally came to the point that both had to be brought into obedience before the Gericht, during this time the Oft-mentioned baker uttered these UnvernÃ¼nfftige words and said, I lie here in the gaol like an honourable man, but if I had stolen 1 bushel corn, then I would be a rogue, out of this there ensued an old silence and Christoph SchrÃ¶ter asked the two brothers who had then stolen 1 bushels corn, Cum Venia, to which George FrÃ¶mbter answered, yes, George Austen had kept it; whereupon SchrÃ¶ter would pay a Gerichts Groschen for it, but because all the Gerichte heard it themselves, it was not necessary and not wanted, out of these, through the baker's and his brother's dissolute tongues, quite a lot of gossip was brought about for us poor people, despite the fact that both brothers, both before the high count's manorial court and also before the Gerichten, spoke out of their hearts, that they did not know anything bad about us, which the strict excellency will remember, (namely also because of this corn most of our communities had knowledge of this, and it was not kept secret from them, in that we did not keep it hidden in a more significant or wicked way), and if we had made a mistake in this, then this should have been known to George FrÃ¶mbter at the beginning, when he led the grain into the barn, both to us and also afterwards to the high count's manorial court, if he had known and understood everything better than we. But often a thoughtless and slip-shod tongue speaks out of knowledge and will, and what is more, at that time the error which George Auster committed and now is forgiven by God and people and covered with the cloak of Christian love, was shamefully and angerly, before all people, and other things besides, by both brothers, Christlichly and honourably, cast up, and to remain silent about it was unChristian, therefore it is sufficient to say that O who stands, may well see that he does not fall like this, but this offence which was undertaken was not Christian but rather Unchristian, therefore the strict excellency the lord domain-captain will take the two conflict- and trouble- causing brothers under his high office protection and Ordain them to be highly obedient, so that in future we can quietly do what is ours, so that not the spirit of conflict might blow this conflict fire out which might strike us, poor people, who would gladly be left in peace. It is an error on the part of the strict excellency to know, we will make it right and make it good, and henceforth show and behave as is Christian and honourable, to all our pursuers under the high office protection, we pray that this will go well and remain with you, and recommendation to God's mercy.\n",

      "To whom it may concern with this certificate: since up to now between Andrea Bemrich, black-dyer in Friedland, on the one part, and then Andrea Bemrich the Younger, black-dyer in Steinau in Silesia, as the said Bemrich in Friedland's legitimate son, on the second part, concerning his, the Younger Bemrich's, inheritance share, which comes partly from a grandmother, namely Margaretha, Valten Kaulferses widow, and partly from his dead mother, there has been for some time conflict, that this, through the mediation of the princely manorial court of Friedland in the presence of the Below-named persons, has been completely agreed and abolished, as follows: since the honourable and learned Mr Fridericus gallus Notary public today, 23 May 1629, appeared in the princely manorial court of Friedland and showed a power of attorney Sighned by the Vogt and Schosser of the town court of Steinau, saying that Andreas Bemrich, citizen and black-dyer from Steinau, appeared in the Gericht there and said that he had an inheritance demand from his father in Friedland, Andrea Bemrich, member of the rat, but that he could not travel there right now, that he therefore gave power of attorney to this Friderico Gallo to act for him, whereupon the said Mr Mandatarius and actor asked that Andreas Bemrich in Friedland as defendant, and debtor be summoned in front of the princely manorial court, be informed of this and be held to just and fast solution and payment. who then upon summoning obediently appeared at the right time. And since report was collected, according to which concerning this inheritance-sharing, that already several years ago a correct agreement was reached and arranged before an honourable council of the town of Friedland, therefore the Gerichtsbuch is sought out and in it under the date 1612 Folio 1612 it was found, how after her death Margaretha Valten Kaulferss' s widow left various mobile and immobile property behind her, to which then there were three right natural heirs, in whose stead however there was an honourable guardianship, lord Christoff Zestermann, Andre Bemrich and Hiob Lohrman, all in Friedlandt and because the inheritance was quite large, therefore after the sharing-out had occurred to him Andre Bemrich respectively on account of his wife and also by succession onto his 4 children, namely Andreas, Cyriacus, Christianus and Maria, there come 311 Schocks 16 Groschens among this inheritance share however was included a piece of arable field beside the Holenstein, which the 3 above-named heirs equally shared, the same was assessed at 230 Schocks, of which as a third share Andrea received a piece assessed at 76 Schocks 40 Groschens and because afterwards the one piece of arable field was sold again, he Pemrich bought the same likewise for the best interests of his children to his previous piece. And when on account of this inheritance which came from Margaretha Kaulferss, Andrea Bemricht with his 4 children from his first marriage agreed, he had promised before an honourable council of the town of Friedland to pay each child 76 Schocks 40 Groschens for this, under which however no child until today except for the daughter Maria has been paid off and satisfied. After his first wife's death, however, he once again agreed in front of an honourable council with his children on account of their maternal share, and for this made over and promised to pay to each child 76 Schocks, so that thus each child for his inheritance share, so partly as said emanating from the grandmother and the other part from their mother, had to demand from their father 151 Schocks 40 Groschens and this inheritance demands also now Mandatarius and actor lord Fridiericus gallus Notary public on behalf of his client Andrea Bemricht black-dyer in Steinau, which the Oft-mentioned Andrea Bemrich senior in Friedland is demanded and commanded to pay. But since Bemrich as debtor admittedly acknowledged this debt (as it is contained in the Gerichtsbuch), and also found himself obliged to pay the same, nevertheless he very movingly brought forward, that at every time as befits a loyal father he watched, and day and night was working, to look after his children well, also through God's blessing and the labour of his hands, sorrow and effort, he obtained a piece of bread and brought it in front of himself, therefore he at the time at the sharing-out of the maternal share, when everything was in boom and good situation, he saw with his children of first marriage more toward the then present good times than on the Unhoped-For following bad times, and thus considered his children with an honourable maternal share, but since through the many military marches and quartering of soldiers, and then the generally difficult and to this day still enduring contributions, he came into very great, irretrievable harm to his livelihood, to such an extent that it is entirely impossible for him to equip his 3 sons with such a large funds, therefore he asked the princely manorial court most Obediely in hoc Passu to derive a medium between him and his children, so that he may both satisfy them in their Legimitate right but also he may as an old aged man provide himself with the necessities, and since this his complaint is not hidden, but rather quite notorious, known to town and country, also to every man, therefore the above mentioned lord Mandataria and Actori Fridrich Gallo was told this in justice, also finally through the following necessary persuasion pro and Contra it was mediated and sentenced so far, that he Andre Gembrich shall pay each of his 3 sons, Andrea, Cyriaco and Christiano, for the mentioned grandmother's and maternal share, the 151 Schocks 40 Groschens, shall pay them 126 Schocks 6 Groschens 4 2/3 denarius, when he thus promised with hand and mouth in the following way to effect and set in work, firstly his dyery in front of the town his son Cyriaco has purchased it for 600 Schocks, when he purchaser shall pay in cash on next St Bartholomew's 300 Schocks, from this cash money he asks to pay each son of his first marriage 50 Schocks second he will cede to the 3 sons the 2 arable fields beside the Holenstein which Origially emanated from the grandmother's inheritance and as said above cost 153 Schocks 20 Groschens, and in equal parts clear them to his sons, each share comes to 51 Schocks 6G 4 2/3 denarius Thirdly he wishes on the deadline of St. Bartholomew's 1630 to the son Andrea Gemrich in Steinau to pay 25 Schocks infallibly, also to agree with the other two thus that no further complaint comes in, so that thus each son for his share shall be given 126 Schocks 6 Groschens 4 2/3 denarius which points and articles then the Mandatorio and Actori Friderico Gallo, as also Andrea Bemricht as debtor, have thus accepted, to keep them firmly, not broken, in good belief, now or in future not to speak, act or do against them, in any way, not doubting that the other 2 sons, Cyriaco and Christiano, shall be likewise accepting it when they are on the spot, and will approve of it.

Not: Pub. on behalf of and in the stead of his client Andreae Bemrich SchwarzferberÃŸ in Steinaw, as is to be seen in the copy of this, demanded and commanded the honourable Bemrich there, as debtor, to pay the sum of 151 Schocks 40 Groschens, which is to be seen in the Gerichtsbuch, and although as debtor he admitted this debt (as it stands in the Gerichtsbuch), nevertheless he totally brought forward how he had at all times, as a loyal father is obliged to do, and it is proper, tried to provide for his children, and had tried day and night to provide for them well, also through God's blessing and his hand-work to earn and bring bread for himself, for which reason at the time of the dividing-up of the maternal share, when everything was in florishing state, he provided his children of his first marriage with a good maternal share, and also looked after them with a good maternal share, but because the various encampments of the soldiers and then the very heavy and still lasting contributiones which he has endured in very great and unavoidable damage to his livelihood, so that it would be quite impossible for him to pay such a high sum to his three sons, therefore he asked the princely manorial court obediently to find a good means between him and his children, so that he might pay both of them their legitimate share, but he as an old man might also ultimately have to endure neediness and suffering, and since this his complaint is hidden in the above, but rather is well-known to everyone in the town and country, and also to everyone, therefore the above-mentioned Mandatarius and attorney Friedricg Gallg. Not: Pub. on behalf of and in the stead of his client Andreae Bemrich.

      "Since when on the 20th of June of this currently running year 1650 the lord brothers von Schwanns once again appeared against lord Melchior von Gersdorff, lord Christian Weygell von Weygelsdorff Vnndt Mertzdorff, as the von Schwanns' s requested auxiliary, says that the two lord brothers von Schwanns appear, and do not doubt that it will be known to the praiseworthy manorial court, how on account of proof, a claimed debt-Demand remained hanging, now because the true state of affairs can be found in the Amts-books and minutes, they render thanks very obediently for the manorial court's communication, if they have nothing other to put forward than a Testament, which was set up here at the praiseworthy town court in Friedland, this is a totally baseless foundation, since human desires are changeable as long as they live, and it also emerges and can be see besides, that the lady Testatrix made a different disposition two years later, and the then interim domain-captain here, Christoff Horn, not only ceded 100 Thlr from her debt-Demand, but also according to a council Bekentnis and attestation here actually Tradiert him the debt Verschreibung, and transferred it to him, concerning the claimed obligation, it was only an empty Scarte, which was prepared counter to the fief-law, also counter to the PrÃ¤gerische Canzley Nottull, and also without consent from the manorial authority, such that the original here states in detail; from which is to be seen, that almost nine Erbherrn have existed in this time, but they have no consent to show from any of them, for which reason the complaining party should provide itself with better proof, and not Litigate with such temerity, not detain minor orphans from their manor of Hermsdorf, not deteriorate the same, and not tire the praiseworthy count's manorial court with this, on top of which according to the Bohemian national ordinance it is held to be a Drimen Lobles Maiestatis when one does not let oneself be stated to by the same law, but rather Consorts with the enemies of the holy Roman Emperor, such that the manorial court minutes proves this, that he set himself into the manor and without the knowledge and will of the manorial authority practised counter to law in the manors of minor orphans, such that then the lord brothers von Schwanns protest against this great injury, that previously an attempt was made actually to involve them in an Actionem Iniuriarum, and do not admit that in the presence of the enemy attempted to get the manor of Hermsdorf, ask for this reason the count's manorial court that they will bring forward the minutes unburdened and have it consulted, how it came to this public lack of basis to their great insult, for which reason jure Reconuentionis they justly have to initiate a counter-Complaint, and ask, because through this they have been brought into irreversible injury, that the praiseworthy manorial court will instruct the Othe Rparty, that they shall pay them the damages, expenses, and deterioration, and because also in the mean time various contracta Simulata have been set up, to abolish them as an, and to annul them, beside which they then implore and appeal to the praiseworthy manorial court, Reseving all legal Nottulln. Hereupon answers lord Johann Frentzell, Notarius Publicus, on behalf of lord Melchior von Gersdorff, and reports, the von Gersdorffs had had to learn with amazement how now the lord brothers von Schwanns are taking it into their heads to take exception with such Wide-Ranging-Ness to their clear letter and seal, once again, and because especially this severe accusation occurred during this, that the complainant von Gersdorff had corresponded with the enemy, whereby he, if it were true, would justly have fallen into a Cassae Meiestatis, therefore he wishes, as an honourable, blameless knight, to take this to heart and mood here in Loco Judicy and immediately, to pursue angrily and vindicate with hoped-for Protestation against such insults Debito Modo, now since this conflictual case rests in in Terminis Transactionis, Cuius Tanta EST UIS et Natura Vt cum Semel Consentu Partirem Perfecta EST, Neq Patientia Partium, NEC Rescripto Principus Neq sub Praesent. Specierum Benuo Reportarum Rescindi Sohnt C. 1619. (de Transactionibus P. And in clear, bright matters all dispute is unnecessary and Otiose, therefore von Gersdorff must humbly request the count's manorial court that it will rest, hear from the lord brothers von Schwanns, whether that, which they agreed to then in the presence of their Beistaende and kin on both sides, and thankfully accepted, they will also now honourably, nobly, as befits knights, comply with, or however the said von Gersdorf leave it up to the highly-Drawn praiseworthy manorial court's decision whether he should not rather protect the above-mentioned agreement instead of making him lose his debt-Demand, Obiter only adds this, but totally not waiving his rights, von Gersdorff says that the Successu Temporis especially the bequeathed or gifted 100 Thlr from the lady Testatrix his demand is precisely included in this amount, also likewise at the agreement which occurred was agreed along with everything, and consequently came to him to pay, thus wishes no further to trouble the count's manorial court with words, but rather to take comfort in the protection of the same and the exercise of rights, asking for this highest possiblity. Replicando answers von Weygell, the lord brothers von Schwanns have learned in what way lord Gersdorff up to this date still seeks to steer himself according to the claimed agreement, now any debt at all must previously be properly proven, since if the begining is not well-Based then the end can also not have any consequences, since the debt in itself was a silent debt, for the prescribed time has passed nearly Fourteenfold, this debt-certificat was set up without arrangement of the consent of the manorial court, and counter to the running of the vassal-law, since no-one is allowed to enter into debts without the consent of the manorial court, therefore it is null and void, the last contract was admittedly sealed by one of the lord brothers, but he did not have any proper power of attorney from the eldest, for in the national ordinance it is clearly provided that the mandate of someone who is absent must be not only sealed by the principal but also confirmed by the Town-court in the same locality where he is dwelling, which however is not found to be true in this case, with with the last agreement was written up with the explicit condition of consent from the manorial authority, which condition however is not present here, thus also there comes to the spot of the brothers von Schwanns, the exception non Numeratus Pecuniae et Erroris, for which reason because in the mean time the claimed debt-certificate has been found, therefore it is regarded by them on account of the Numerousness of the lacks and Nullities, as a Nouum Emergens and to them also the legal means that are being used justly are regarded by them as an exception, on top of this 700 Reichstalersr were dunned and it now turns out that 100 Reichstalersr on it have already been paid, and they had nonetheless let themselves be introduced into the manor for the entire sum, even though Horn had never dunned or complained concerning his debt. The von Gersdorffs answer, the von Schwanntzes' grandfather, who had become pledge for this debt, was at that time himself domain-captain and thus there was consent enough, the 100 Reichstalersr which Horn claims, they were obliged to make good to him, they wish also on that account to represent the von Schwanns.\n",

      "Since on 20 June of this current year 1650 the lord brothers von Schwanns currently lord Melchior von Gersdorff appeared, lord Christian Weygell von Weygelsdorff Vndt Mertzdorff, as their supporter, reported that the two lord brothers von Schwanns appeared and said that they did not know that it was well-known to the manorial court how it had stood with the probating of a claimed debt-Demand, because the true state of affairs was to be found in the manorial-court minutes and minutes, they rendered their obedience to the manorial court, if they had not had anything to protect other than a testament which had been set up here with the manorial court in Friedland, this was a very groundless foundation, since human will is changeable as long as they live, and besides this it was to be seen that the lady testatrix two years after made another disposition and the then interim captain of this place Christoff Horn not only waived their debt-Demand but also according to a decision of the council here ceded and transferred the debt-writing to him, the Simulated debt-Document was only a Lehre Scarte, which conflicted with the fief-laws and also with the Prague chancellery Nottull, and also was prepared without the consent of the manorial authority, as can be seen from the original here, from which it can be seen that almost 9 hereditary lords existed in this time, but none of them were to be shown to have given any consent, therefore the complaining party should make itself better with proof, and not litigate in a more extensive way, especially not to Deter the manor of the lady von Schwanns which they have not yet occupied, and to Deter the manorial court, before this according to the Bohemian national ordinance it is held to be a crime against majesty if one does not comply with the decision of the manorial court, but rather with the help of the papal power, as is to be seen in the manorial court minutes, this was done without the knowledge of the manorial authority and the consent of the manor of the minor wards, as the lord brothers von Schwanns protested against this great Iniuriam, that previously they were supposed to be drawn into an Iniuriary action, and that they had not agreed that the manor of the enemy was occupied, they ask that the minutes be brought forward without being burdened, so that these Iniurien can be refuted, and they will not let the manorial court do anything without the consent of the manor of the minor wards, because this is a public groundless thing to them, they have a just Reconuentionis to make against the von Schwanns, and ask that the von Gersdorff be told to bring his debt-Demand forward, and to accept the von Schwanns' offer, if he has any more to lose than his debt-Demand, otherwise he will be ruined, the von Weygell answers that the von Schwanns are trying to Excipiren themselves again against their clear letter and seal, and because especially this heavy accusation has been made against them, that von Gersdorff has corresponded with the enemy, which would otherwise be justifiably in a Cassae Meiestatis, as an honourable and untainted knight he would have to have this Iniuriam refuted and vindicated here in loco Judicy and immediately in heart and body, with protestation that he will not let this slide, because this conflictual case has rested in a transaction, which is of such a nature that it is complete once consented, the patience of the parties, and the rescue of the principal, and especially that the von Gersdorff is to be told to bring the von Schwanns forward, if they have anything to say, to hear their case, because this is a just Reconuentionis, and he will have lost more than his debt-Demand, the von Weygell adds that the von Schwanns have claimed 700 Reichstalersr, and 100 Reichstalers have already been paid, they would have paid the whole sum if Horn had not claimed it, but Horn had never dunned or complained about it, the von Gersdorff answer that their von Schwanns' grandfather who stood surety for this debt was at that time himself domain-captain and thus had sufficient consent, they were obliged to make good to him the 100 Reichstalers which Horn claims, they will also represent the von Schwanns in this.\n",

      "They make the humble application, since they cannot be satisfied with the 1 1/2 board-mill-days which their dead father Anton Augsten after their mother's death left by will to the 3 sons Anton, Hans Michel and Hans Christoff, but rather request that they, after the death of their mother, should all collectively inherit these 1 1/2 days, and be able to cut them. Since the kinship was not all gathered together, they were summoned to the count's manorial court chancellery on 10 Jan 1782, and they also all appeared. And were asked whether they might have reached an agreement, which they answered however with no. Therefore they were informed of the manorial presentation: 1. admittedly it was just that the father's will should stand, because it was to be suspected that those who were not mentioned in the father's will probably had received their share in a just division 2. Hans Michel and Hans Christoff were allocated the division of the smallholding, also now this was assessed to them for a very small sum namely 100 Schocks 3. It was not feasible to grant their petition because they were located in different villages, that they could divide, but rather the board-mill-days had to remain together in the village, and could be divided at most into 1/2 and 1/4 days. Additionally the manorial provision and declaration occurred, that the 1 1/2 board-mill-days should fall after the mother's death to the heirs living in Weisbach, and namely shall be paid by Elisabeth on the Lower board-mill 1/2 day, Anna Rosina 1/2 day there, Veronica on the village headman's mill 1/4 day, and Anton on the village headman's mill 1/4 day, for these board-mill-days.\n",

Since the siblings were not all together on the 10th of January 1782 in the countly manorial court, which also all appeared collectively, and were asked whether they had perhaps already reached agreement, but they all answered no, therefore the manorial court was told: 1stly, although it is just that the father's will should have a Fuhr-Sath, because it is to be assumed that those who did not think of this in the will could have had a plentiful Ausatz of what was theirs 2ndly, lord Michl and lord Christoph are already long dealt with concerning the partitioning of the smallholding, also the latter shall be given a very small quantum namely 100 Schocks of board-milling 3rdly, it is not just to grant their Petito, because they are settled and located in various villages, and they cannot cut up the board-milling days together, but rather they must remain in the village and can only be divided into 1/3 and 1/4 days. Therefore the manorial court's decision and judgement is that the 1.5 board-milling days shall fall to the heirs living in Weisbach after the mother's death, and namely Elisabeth on the lower board-milling 1/2 day, Anna Rosina there 1/2 day, Veronica on Scholtz's board-milling 1/4 day, and Anton on Scholtz's board-milling 1/4 day, for these board-milling days.\n",
