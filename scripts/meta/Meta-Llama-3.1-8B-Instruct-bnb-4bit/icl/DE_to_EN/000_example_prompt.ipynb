Now since the first deadline is upon us, and the second will not get lost, in order to do what is required for the mentioned general national Diet's grant, therefore the following assessment for the above intention is weighed as being feasible, namely that each peasant shall infallibly pay 14 K, half-peasant 8 K, smallholders 6 K, and cottager 3 K, within the next 14 days from today, to the castle here, holding that for this assessment, the above mentioned two deadlines shall suffice, for which reason each village headman ist to demand in from his community people according to the ordinance which has been made, the set-out money, and along with a list of how many peasants, half-peasants, smallholders and cottagers he has in his community, to hand into the hands of the military-contribution-collector at the castle, in return for a certificate. which I rely on occurred.

If the first term, and the second will not be relinquished, then the unanimous approval of the general national Diet will suffice to meet the demands. Therefore, it was considered advisable to assess the following: namely, each peasant 14 Kreuzers, half-peasant 8 Kreuzers, gardener 6 Kreuzers, and cottager 3 Kreuzers, from today onwards within the next 14 days, which amount should cover the aforementioned two terms. Each village headman should inform his community members of the assessment, so that the specified money can be demanded, and in addition, designate how many peasants, half-peasants, gardeners, and cottagers he has in his community, to be presented to the collector of contributions, against receipt.

However, after he unhitched his horse and went to the house, Hans von Gersdorff, his acquaintance, was noticed by him, and immediately rode towards him with drawn sword. He, however, saved himself by fleeing into a peasant's house, and the two of them searched for him with drawn swords. As they did not find him, they rode away amidst numerous lamentations. Our gracious lord, however, considers this incident of Gersdorff's to be an ungrateful act, and orders that the reasons for this should be explained to the village headman of LeÃ¼ckersdorff. Gersdorff defends himself, stating that he and his brother-in-law, Hans von Gersdorff, had ridden to Reichenau earlier that day, and when they arrived at the village tavern, the village headman was standing in the doorway, and when his brother-in-law saw him, he jumped off his horse, drew his sword, and struck the village headman. Then, seeing that the village headman had entered the house, he jumped off his horse again, drew his sword, and struck the village headman. As he considered that they might harm each other, he struck them both with his dagger. Our gracious lord has referred this matter to the village headman of LeÃ¼ckersdorff, and has reconciled with him, but has also given a suitable explanation.\n",
