      "Friedland the 20th of June 1678 there appeared Dittersbach Scholtes Gotfried Leibner with his sister Elisabeth VerEheligten KrauÃŸin, with the request that for the son Joseph Leibner who is missing in Gitschin currently, an official assurance be issued for him. In return his sister, the said KrauÃŸin, will bind herself credibly to hypothecate her entire property in general and specific to the countly manorial court. The Elisabeth KrauÃŸin was thus asked whether she wishes to do so in this form for the son Joseph Leibner, to guarantee him good everywhere and at all times, and thus with all her property to be good for him. Whereupon she thus with her own hand has vowed to mortgage and to keep everything.\n",
